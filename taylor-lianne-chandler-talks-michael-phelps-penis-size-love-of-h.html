Their Facebook exchanges provide an interesting glimpse into the swimmer’s relationships and&nbsp;romantic preferences:</p><p>“The first time I had sex with him, I bled,” Chandler says of Phelps. There is a stain on the love sack to the left looking at it.”</p><p>“It’s kinda skinny, but long,” Smith replies. “Def not girthy. Funny you bled. I’m gonna look and see if he had the stain removed. If Nicole ever gets the F outta there!”</p><p>The “love sack” is apparently Phelps’ preferred sex spot. The women reference it several times, with Chandler&nbsp;remarking at one point, “That poor love sack has lived up to its name!” and Smith responding, “It’s gross how many of us have had sex on that thing.”</p><p>Both women say they were emotionally wounded by their relationships with Phelps. At one point, Chandler compares herself to the prostitutes that she says Phelps frequently patronizes.</p><p>“He has obviously hurt a lot of women,” Chandler says. “Sex workers know what they are getting, but to think your [sic] special and find out it was built on lies sucks.”</p><p>“It does hurt,” Smith agrees. “Very different than pay for play.”</p><p>Later in the conversation, Smith laments having signed the confidentiality agreement, as it prevents her from talking to the media about her relationship with Phelps.</p><p>Chandler signed no such document and clearly intends to take advantage of her situation:</p><p>“I’m going to continue doing TV and appearances,” she tells Smith. “I had my birthday party at a strip club. You think that was my choice? LOL I needed the money for the appearance…I say his name and bash him in almost every interview.”</p><p>The several-day exchange between Chandler and Smith ends with Chandler trying to enlist Smith in a hunt for a photo of Phelps’ penis:</p><p>“Thought we found the girl with the dick pic, but it was a fake profile,” Chandler says. “You don’t by chance have a dick pic that wouldn’t incriminate you or scandalous info?”</p><p>Looks like Ms. Chandler won’t be removed from Phelps’ life as easily as he had hoped.</p><p>Check out some of the text message exchanged between the former lovers in the gallery below:</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Taylor Lianne Chandler-Michael Phelps Texts: I Just Want to Be With You!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2ptX2V%2FcMDAsqOoql2htqK6zZ5knKCRo7GtsdFmq5qkm6h6rrXCoZiepF2ltaa4z6xkqZ2ensBuv8iznGakn6uybrvFZp9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
