In a news release, Blanchester police said the woman was found “in a pit dug into the earthen floor of the shed.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pit was about three-and-a-half feet deep and two feet wide and it had been apparently covered by wood and “heavy objects,” police said in the release.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The woman was removed and hospitalized, though she showed no physical trauma, according to police. She was later released, according to a local report.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dunn was taken into custody about 8 a.m. Wednesday and charged with kidnapping, police said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to court officials and records, he remains in the county jail on $1 million bond and has entered a not guilty plea. It is unclear if he has retained an attorney.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He will next appear in court on May 3.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Blanchester Police Department</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dunn’s arrest caps off a series of sometimes volatile interactions with both police and the neighbor he allegedly abducted, whom he has “known for some time,” according to authorities:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October, the woman reported “harassing phone calls and text messages from Dunn” but declined to participate in any prosecution, police said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dunn also called police five times over two days in early April claiming he could hear voices and that people had broken into or were attempting to break into his home, where he lived alone. But officers found no one else inside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b><i>• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? </i></b><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noreferrer><b><i>Click here</i></b></a><b><i> to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.</i></b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dunn was involuntarily admitted to the local hospital for a psychiatric evaluation following one such call, when police returned to his home because neighbors said he was in his yard with a gun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He was subsequently disarmed without injury in that incident, police said. However, he was released from the hospital within 24 hours.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Chief Blasts State’s Mental Health Care</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an unusually public step for law enforcement, the Blanchester police chief tied Dunn’s alleged actions to what he called a “failure” of Ohio’s mental health care system.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It would appear to me that Mr. Dunn is in need of some sort of psychiatric treatment,” Chief Scott Reinbolt said in a news release earlier in April, following Dunn’s repeated police calls but before the alleged abduction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Over the past several decades the State of Ohio has closed most of [its] inpatient mental health facilities, leaving few beds available for individuals who need inpatient care,” Reinbolt said. “Unfortunately, I am convinced that doing so has left individuals like Mr. Dunn without the care and treatment they need and deserve.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Dunn’s arrest Wednesday, the chief added in a second news release, “I was heartbroken when Dunn’s elderly father showed up at the scene this morning to apologize to us for having to deal with this son. I am angry at a state government that places dangerous, mentally ill people into our neighborhoods.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Referring to the victim, Reinbolt said he was “aghast at the threat this situation poses” to other people like her in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Ontq6xjpujmqaTnbK0wMSrZKigmaR6rq3NZqKinJ6WvbR5xZ6kmqSVYrumtcahmaiqXaW2tXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
