Right?</p><p>Well now one mum-of-three has revealed an incredible solution for cleaning even the filthiest of staircase - and the pictures are nothing short of game-changing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000465850099.jpg><p>Posting in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mrs Hinch</a> Facebook <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fan group</a>, the mum - who lives in Portadown, Northern Ireland - wrote: "Our stairs get a lot of traffic with kids running straight upstairs from outside so I read somewhere about 'Elbow Grease' and thought I would give it a bash before ringing in a professional cleaner."</p><p>Asking her fellow 125,000 group members to "please don't judge", the mother posted before-and-after snaps of her tired stairs before revealing the two affordable cleaning products she used to achieve the impressive results.</p><p>Delving into the four-step method, the mother wrote: "I sprayed with Elbow Grease and then left it for 10 minutes.</p><p>"Then I rubbed in Dr Beckmann carpet cleaner and left it for 20 minutes."</p><p>After using the two deep cleaning sprays - which only set her back £4 - the mother then "scrubbed with warm water and a hard-brush and then rubbed it with a white towel."</p><p>In fact, the four-step process (which took less than an hour) proved so vigorous for the mum that she even joked about cancelling her spin class later that day.</p><p>But sore arms and £4 seems like an incredibly small price to pay for a carpet which looks as good as new. Amirite?</p><p>Unsurprisingly, other cleaning fans have been similarly blown away by the home transformation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000465850100.jpg><p>Praising the mum for her honesty, one user replied: "You should be so proud, your house is clearly well loved and lived in which does for the majority of us who don't all have 'show homes'.</p><p>Another wrote: "Great job. I hope everyone will take their shoes off after all your hard work."</p><p>Impressed with the mother's determination, a third added: "Amazing job - looks like a huge amount of hard work. Well done you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000465858055.jpg><ul><li><strong>Elbow Grease De-Greader, £1 for 500ml from Tesco - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy now</a></strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000465858145-e1549025201259.jpg><ul><li><strong>Dr Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover, £3 for 650ml from Wilko - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy now</a></strong></li></ul><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>For more household cleaning hacks, this mum has revealed how a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">£1 household vinegar made her crusty kettle as good as new</a> within a few SECONDS.</p><p>Plus this mum uses <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tomato ketchup to clean grime off her bathroom drain</a> in mere minutes- and the photos speak for themselves.</p><p>And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shoppers can't get enough of the 89p cleaning paste from Home Bargains</a> that is a favourite with Mrs Hinch.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mum shares simple cleaning hack she uses to get her kettle to shine</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5dsamlsY258rsHMZp2ipKSdxm6%2F05qgq5uRqLJur8uemKehnpx6qa3CpGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
