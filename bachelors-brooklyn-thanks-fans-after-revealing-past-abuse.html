It does not go unnoticed and it is more appreciated than anyone will ever know,” the rodeo racer, 25, wrote via her Instagram Story on Tuesday, February 14, one day after <a href=#>her emotional conversation</a> aired.</p><p>Along with her message of thanks, Brooklyn reposted a fan’s video of footage from <a href=#>her date with Zach</a>, 26. The twosome went on a one-on-one date during the Monday, February 13, episode of the ABC series as the tech exec and his remaining women <a href=#>traveled to the Bahamas</a>.</p><p>After a fun-filled day of ATV riding on the beach, the pair sat down for dinner. Brooklyn began by stating that she admires her grandparents’ relationship and told Zach that <a href=#>she was in a long-term relationship</a> that became <a href=#>emotionally and physically abusive</a>.</p><p>“I honestly never got into details with anyone ’cause it sometimes reopens wounds. … For six whole years, I was not myself. And I woke up one day and was like, ‘No, this can’t define me,'” the Oklahoma native said. “I truly believe that if I wouldn’t have just woke up and got out, I can literally guarantee I would not be sitting here right now.”</p><p>Brooklyn was <a href=#>overcome with emotion</a> while sharing her experience. During a confessional interview, she recalled that the relationship got to such a harmful point that she woke up one night to find cops nearby after she was knocked out by her now-ex.</p><p>Zach later told the cameras that he was “blown away” by Brooklyn’s strength after she admitted that she “never had a reciprocated love.”</p><p>The Bachelorette alum told his date: “You’ve gone through battles that I didn’t imagine but you are so f–king tough, and it makes me sick to my stomach that you had to go through something like that.”</p><p>Following Brooklyn’s emotional reveal, host <a href=#><strong>Jesse Palmer</strong></a> <a href=#>took to social media</a> to share his support. “Heartbreaking to hear Brooklyn talk about her past relationship. She is so strong, courageous and deserving of love and happiness,” he tweeted on Monday.</p><p>This isn’t the first time contestants on the series have shed light on their difficult pasts. During a June 2021 episode of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, <a href=#><strong>Katie Thurston</strong></a> opened up about <a href=#>her past experience with sexual assault</a>.</p><p>“I had been drinking, and I was involved in a situation where there wasn’t consent,” she said while on a group date. “And I was in denial about what happened, so much so that I tried to form a relationship with him, because I didn’t want to believe what actually had happened. … I just want you guys to know I’ve come a long way from who I was 10 years ago, and how important consent is.”</p><p>Season 27 of The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the <a href=#>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been sexually abused, call the <a href=#>National Sexual Assault Hotline</a> at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).
