The 50-year-old Oscar nominee shared a clip to his Instagram on January 8 where he hilariously introduced his fans to his 18-year-old daughter <strong>Ella’s</strong> boyfriend. During the video (below), Mark is in the middle of a workout when he addresses the camera. “I used to work out to keep the boys away from my girls,” he began, referencing Ella and her 11-year-old sister <strong>Grace</strong>. “And now I’m working out with the boyfriend,” Mark said, as he walked over to Ella’s beau and patted him on the back. “Imagine that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As any parent would know, that’s a sound strategy to keep an eye on the person dating your kid! Mark certainly got the thumbs up from his followers. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mario Lopez</strong></a> commented, “<span>Heyyy keep ‘em close. Smart,” while <strong>Octavia Spencer</strong> shared four heart emojis. Even Ella, who could have been totally embarrassed by the dad move, cosigned the clip, writing, “Luv u dad.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>This isn’t the first time Mark has brought up his eldest child’s love life. During a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2017 interview</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;The Graham Norton Show, Mark told the hilarious anecdote about one of Ella’s first dates, who turned the tables on the former rapper. “You want to hang out with him? I wanna meet him, and then you can hang out with him in a safe environment,” Mark said. “All of a sudden, this kid comes over, and he one-ups me: he brings his mom.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Mark and Ella certainly have a close bond, as her birth in September 2003 was the same day his sister <strong>Debbie</strong> died at the age of 43. On Ella’s 18th birthday, Mark <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a photo</a> of himself and Ella alongside a photo of himself and Debbie.&nbsp;“Happy B day my Ella. 18 years old wow how time flies. So proud of you!!” he captioned the heartbreaking post. “Always A bittersweet day. Missing my big sister Debbie Ella’s Guardian angel.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Along with Ella and Grace, Mark also shares <strong>Michael</strong>, 15, and <strong>Brendan</strong>, 13 with his wife <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rhea Durham</a>,&nbsp;</strong>43, whom he married in 2009.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49yZqaZoqB6uK3HpZmeqpdixLC%2ByqxkqK2kYrGiwcahq56qXZq5ra2Mm51mrpmZsrB7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
