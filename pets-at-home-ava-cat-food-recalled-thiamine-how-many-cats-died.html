died?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>HIGH street giant Pets at Home has recalled a number of dry cat foods and issued a warning after cats became seriously ill amid reports at least one pet has died.</p><p>The popular store said several brands of the AVA dry cat food had insufficient levels of thiamine (vitamin B1) which could leave some moggies malnourished.</p><img

Standards Agency issued a recall for the product&nbsp;after at least three cats became "seriously unwell".<br>The Sun Online has also learned one pet cat died after suffering from a fit, <a href=#>with its devastated owners believing the cat food could be to blame.</a></p><p>Safety chiefs warned four lines of the cat food are being recalled after the animals&nbsp;were hit.<br>Here's what we know...</p><p><h2>What happened to those cats affected?</h2></p><p>The product was revealed to not have enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in it, causing the cats to become unwell.</p><p>Most of the pets became seriously unwell four to six weeks after switching to one of the affected products and required veterinary care.</p><p>All three reported cats exhibited symptoms of sudden collapse, fitting, widespread twitching and general unsteadiness .</p><p>A statement from Pets At Home said: "An investigation has revealed that, in the four affected products, the level of thiamine (vitamin B1) was much lower than we had specified.</p><p>"Testing confirmed only these four products are affected."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict0003057183682.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000305376575.jpg><h2>What is thiamine and why it is important to cats?</h2><p>Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is a vitamin necessary for normal carbohydrate metabolism in cats.</p><p>Thiamine deficiency results in serious symptoms, many of which are neurological in origin.</p><p>Signs include circling, falling, head tilt, dilated pupils, stupor and seizures.</p><p>Neurological symptoms may be preceded by symptoms such as vomiting.</p><p>Excess salivation, depressed appetite, and weight loss can also be seen.</p><p>There are many potential causes of thiamine deficiency&nbsp;including consumption of diet which has<br>destroyed vitamin B1 during food processing.</p><p>Some food recalls have been related to thiamine destruction which occurred during processing and caused inadequate thiamine levels in food.</p><p>Food lacking adequate quantities of thiamine may in turn cause a thiamine deficiency for cats eating the food.</p><h2>How many cats have died?</h2><p>To date just one pet cat's demise has been linked to the product.</p><p>However, Pets at Home has confirmed it is aware of three cats which have suffered severe symptoms after eating the food.</p><p>A spokesman for the store said: "We are aware of three cats which, sadly, became seriously unwell four to six weeks after switching to one of the affected products and required veterinary care."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What products are affected?</h3></p><p>Product: AVA Veterinary
