The actor has agreed to play the lead in a romantic Korean drama. Park Gyu-young, who starred in Dali and Cocky Prince, will play the female protagonist opposite Cha Eun-woo in the program. The show’s working title is A Good Day to Be a Dog.</p><p>The show is based on a webcomic, and production is slated to begin in October 2022. So yet, there has been no confirmation of the broadcast time. The program is also not currently affiliated with a broadcast network. Lee Hyun-woo will also play an important part in the program. He rose to prominence after portraying Rio in Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area, Korea’s version of Money Heist.</p><h2>Cha Eun-program woos is based on what webtoon?</h2><p>A Good Day to Be a Dog is the literal translation of the webcomic’s title. This was written by Lee Hye and is praised by manhwa fans all around the nation. Han Hae-na, a single lady who works as a high school teacher, is the subject of the webcomic. This is the character that Park Gyu-young will play. This webcomic has a fantasy element to it. Hae-forefathers na’s committed a mistake and were cursed as a result. This curse is still alive in the current day.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Park-Gyu-young-1.jpg alt="Park Gyu-young" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the curse, if anybody in their family kisses someone, they will transform into a dog at midnight and remain a dog for six hours. They then return to their human form. This happens every night until the person in dog shape can kiss the same person again.</p><p>Hae-na wishes to escape this tragedy, therefore whenever she encounters a prospective love interest, she demands that they refrain from kissing her. The males vanish from her life the instant she brings up the matter. After becoming intoxicated, a disgruntled Hae-na unintentionally kisses Jin Seo-won, played by Cha Eun-woo. He is a teacher at the same high school where Hae-na works.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cha-Eun-woo-2.jpg alt="Cha Eun-woo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Sadly for Hae-na, Cha Eun-character woo’s Seo-won is afraid of dogs. This was the result of a painful incident he had as a child. As a consequence, Hae-na finds it difficult to approach Seo-won. The story hinges on whether she can get him to kiss a dog.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmqqbYrS6wYyypq6ml2Kur7CMmqqtqp%2BoeqS0wGacrqZdrLywedaio6Vlkpp6pK3SrWSipl2Wu27Bz5ympqGenHqzu8yapZydXZm%2FornAaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
