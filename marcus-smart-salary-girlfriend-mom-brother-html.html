So, here is everything you need to know about his life away from basketball.</p><h2>Marcus Smart Is 28 Years of Age</h2><p>Marcus was born on March 6, 1994, making him 28 years old as of this writing. He was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, by his parents,&nbsp;Billy Frank Smart and Camellia Smart.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Growing up, he attended&nbsp;Edward S. Marcus High School in Flower Mound, Texas, and subsequently moved to&nbsp;Oklahoma State for his college. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And it was between those years of high school and college; he sharpened his skills as a basketball player by participating in various age-level competitions.</p><h2>His Mother Passed Away Due to Cancer</h2><p>On September 17, 2018,&nbsp;Marcus took to his Twitter to post a touching tribute to his mom, Camellia, confirming she had passed away after losing her&nbsp;battle with cancer.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"I feel like I'm suffocating and the person who helps me get through things [has] left me but I know [you're] in a better place with no more worries, no more hurt, no more sadness or pain," he wrote in&nbsp;a note attached with his tweet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The same year in August, the&nbsp;Celtics guard had revealed that his mother, who was 63 years old, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was&nbsp;diagnosed</a> with myelodysplastic syndrome, a form of cancer caused by abnormalities in the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"At this point, from what they told me, they’re just trying to preserve life right now," he said publicly.&nbsp;"You can’t fix it. Would have to get a whole transplant, and at her age that’s tough. Transplant would probably be more harmful than good."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In addition to his mom, Marcus&nbsp;had also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lost his older brother</a>&nbsp;Todd Westbrook to cancer&nbsp;at the age of 33 in 2004&nbsp;— at that time, the NBA star was just nine years old.&nbsp;He has three older siblings: Todd (deceased), Jeff Westbrook, and Michael Smart. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Giving a tribute to his brother, he now has a tattoo that reads "33" on his triceps, which represents the age when his brother passed away.
