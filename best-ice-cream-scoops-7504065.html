As one of the most universally loved desserts by children and adults alike, ice cream is the perfect summertime treat. However, the ice cream truck might not come ‘round your neighborhood too often, so you may need to master the fine art of scooping your own treat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than struggling with an ice cream scoop that won’t dig, is tricky or messy to use, or feels uncomfortable in your hands, consider one of our top selections.&nbsp;"The type of scoop absolutely matters and can make a huge difference between a tweaked wrist and a beautiful scoop," Tyler Malek, co-founder and head ice cream maker at Salt & Straw tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While Malek says a spoon or spatula can get the job done, if you invest in an ice cream scoop, you should steer clear of trigger scoops (better suited for cookie dough), spades, and scoops with pointed tips. "And pay no mind to scoops with anti-freeze inside. Unless you’re scooping all day, there’s no point," he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did the ‘hard’ work of testing 24 ice cream scoops for durability, efficiency, effectiveness, design, and user experience — and enjoyed the fruits of our labor. After multiple tests totaling 10 hours of scooping, we found our winners.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kick off summer with the very best ice cream scoops that PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-joseph-joseph-dimple-non-drip-ice-cream-scoop></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Joseph Joseph Dimple Ice Cream Scoop</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Joseph Joseph Dimple Non-Drip Ice Cream Scoop" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/otOK3Dt7G2NXdj6EUDmPbA5PIuc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/joseph-joseph-dimple-non-drip-ice-cream-scoop-f2e28c1976894100a3506480e61ad209.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>It creates great scoops with less mess and clean-up.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The design of the handle and scoop is lightweight and feels good to hold.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The scooper not only creates round balls, but it releases ice cream fast.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to shopping for kitchen gadgets, do you often seek practical, seamless, and budget-friendly solutions? Our overall pick for the best ice cream scoop checks all the boxes — and we can’t find a single drawback to report on. That’s a win, right?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s the Goldilocks of ice cream scoops: the grip, the scoop shape, and the price are just right. It’s lightweight, and the symmetrical grip is slim and comfortable, making it easy to hold. The handle is also weighted and flat on the end, so it can stand upright on the counter. Why does this matter? The collar under the scoop prevents drippings from making a melted mess you’ll have to clean up after dessert. The scoop mechanism provides a round-like shape and releases easily for Instagram-worthy plating.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we tested it against ice cream directly out of the freezer and ice cream left out to defrost a bit, it easily held up and dug in.

This easy-to-grip scoop is also durable and dishwasher-safe. The chrome-plated head on the scoop is tough, and the smooth contours allow for consistent ice cream scoops. We found it straightforward, effective, and a smart addition to your collection of kitchen goods.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One feature to note is that this scoop has a squared edge on one side, unlike the other selections on our list. When using our right hand, we found this helpful to get to the bottom of a pint or half-gallon of ice cream, leaving no drop behind. However, it might not be comfortable for a left-handed person since the leading edge was designed only with righties in mind. Lefties may find it difficult to hold and could result in an indent on your hand as you dig in.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 2.17 x 0.98 x 8.66 inches | <strong>Material Type:</strong> Chrome-plated cast zinc and plastic | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heavy-duty-sumo-ice-cream-scoop></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Heavy-Duty</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sumo Ice Cream Scoop</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sumo Ice Cream Scoop" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/O2DOokHxOTpi5WvvoOWhG27jIaE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sumo-ice-cream-scoop-fbeba88a1d49421c957f47932d94210f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>The heavy-duty handle offers a solid, trustworthy grip.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The durable scoop is dishwasher-safe and fast to clean.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The scoop is available in five bright color options.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you need to dig deep into your soul — or, er, your emotional support ice cream pint — you need a heavy-duty handle for the job. Compared to the other ice cream scoops we tested, this one was the heaviest of all — but in a good way. With a solid grip and texture, it was comfortable and easy to hold, and the added weight created a much-needed balance, allowing us to scoop more easily.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We gave it a high durability rating since it quickly removed the ice cream from the pint or half-gallon, even if it was fresh out of the freezer. It doesn’t feature a release aspect, so it can be a little tricky to remove from the scoop into the bowl, but nothing a clean finger or spoon can’t fix. We appreciate the five bright color options — and the fact it’s dishwasher-safe, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 8.07 x 1.42 x 1.14 inches | <strong>Material Type: </strong>Stainless steel and thermoplastic elastomer rubber | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ergonomic-grip-gorilla-grip-original-ice-cream-scooper></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Ergonomic Grip</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gorilla Grip Original Ice Cream Scooper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Gorilla Grip Original Ice Cream Scooper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pw5fNCF4Po0USa49rLnQwSv89T8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gorilla-grip-original-ice-cream-scooper-ca51b5e298e9417eb0552107d16108e0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>With a solid, easy-to-use design, this scooper is a great value and investment.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The ergonomic grip of this ice cream scoop is comfortable and easy to hold.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This ice cream features a unique modern design.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re aging, have arthritis, or spend hours typing away at your keyboard, wrist pain is a reality for many.

It has a solid, slightly weighted design with an easy-to-grip handle. Along the side of the scoop are several indented areas where you can place your fingers and thumb, providing improved grip and flexibility for different hand sizes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, we quickly scooped up ice cream of all textures and frozen levels without difficulty.

You can choose from five handle color options, and while it may not have as many bells and whistles as other ice cream scoops, it gets the job done.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>7.87 x 2.28 x 1.89 inches | <strong>Material Type:</strong> Zinc alloy and plastic | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-getting-to-the-bottom-of-the-pint-kitchenaid-gourmet-ice-cream-scoop></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Getting to the Bottom of the Pint</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>KitchenAid Gourmet Ice Cream Scoop</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon KitchenAid Gourmet Ice Cream Scoop" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kp1CbbkdC8EWqL92l-8rnL47CqE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kitchenaid-gourmet-ice-cream-scoop-6c7dd9d481a54affb96edf47642ca688.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>This ice cream scoop features a longer handle, providing better reach into containers with less mess.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The design of this gourmet ice cream scoop digs easily and quickly into ice cream.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This ice cream scoop features an ergonomic grip that’s comfortable and easy to hold.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’re craving ice cream, and you’re down to your very last bit at the bottom. As you dig in, your wrist or hand brushes up against the side of the carton, and you’re now sticky. To the rescue is this gourmet ice cream scoop with an ergonomic, smooth, comfortable handle that’s longer than most others.

And the last thing you want is to battle with a scoop that’s difficult to use and doesn’t help you relieve your sweet tooth. Our pick for the easiest ice cream scoop to use is this stainless steel option with a black rubber grip. Though there isn’t anything fancy about it, we appreciate the smart design with a rubber grip that’s comfortable to hold and a stainless steel scoop that cuts through even super-frozen ice cream surprisingly well. We tested it against various levels of frozenness, using pints and half-gallons alike, and found it quickly scooped up wonderful round balls of deliciousness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only drawback is it doesn’t release ice cream as well as some others on our list, and you likely will need to use a clean finger or spoon for plating.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 10.45 x 1.4 x 4.25 inches | <strong>Material Type:</strong> Stainless steel and thermoplastic | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Hr3aFNq_r4w7op2VpJWXZBDuFe4=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-ice-cream-scoops-test-oxo-good-grips-stainless-steel-wdickey-167-c44bf4f4429e475f82f25c5690b32b58.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/r-lDITG-f-fUo5OKP9McyuT_z7s=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-ice-cream-scoops-test-oxo-good-grips-stainless-steel-wdickey-163-c3fa9ad1014e44b4bd06b9c448d3beda.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Will Dickey</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-kitchenaid-classic-ice-cream-scoop></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>KitchenAid Ice Cream Scoop</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Ice Cream Scoop" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/cfkGnw2PrbUjxqPdh9xWfGi1i3I=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/KitchenAid-Scoop-12fd49f6ed3a467793d8def0f126dceb.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>KitchenAid</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>This smartly-designed ice cream scoop has a long handle, allowing you to get out every last bit of frozen dessert.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The slightly weighted ice cream scoop is durable and provides a solid grip.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The scooper releases the frozen dessert quickly and easily.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes we have an immediate good first impression of a product during our testing process.

These include notebooks, pens, scissors — and perhaps, ice cream scoops. This pick works equally well for both dominant hands but was especially comfortable and easy to grip for left-handed folks. The added weight and the handle shape provide extra traction when you hold it in your left hand. We also found that the shape of the scoop allowed us to form nicely shaped balls of ice cream.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though overall, it’s easy to use, features a good grip, and is a great size for most hand shapes, this pick does come with some considerations.

In our testing, we found that the material of the handle directly affected our comfort level. For example, a stainless steel handle is durable, but not one you'd like to use for a long period of time. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a handle with a rubberized grip, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">OXO Good Grips Ice Cream Scoop</a>, makes for a more comfortable scooping experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The length of the handle also makes a big difference.

For the everyday consumer, it's more difficult to get into small pints with a spade and it's equally as difficult to dig into the ice cream and shape it into a ball. These types of scoopers are best left to the ice cream experts.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People/Will Dickey</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-ice-cream-scoops></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Ice Cream Scoops</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To get to the bottom of the best ice cream scoops — and the bottom of containers — we put 24 scoops through two tests over the course of 10 hours. First, we powered our way through a pint container of Häagen-Dazs to assess the scoop’s performance, scooping out ice cream with a firmer texture and maneuvering in a pint container. We used each scoop to take three scoops, using our left hand at least once.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We then noticed how well the scoop fit into the pint container and how easy it was to maneuver. Then, we considered the grip: was it comfortable to hold? Did it quickly release the ice cream and provide neat scoops for plating? Lastly, we washed and dried the scoop and ran it through the dishwasher if applicable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For our second test, we dug into a half-gallon container of Blue Bell ice cream, known for its airier, lighter texture. This time, we removed five scoops and concentrated on the surface without digging too deep.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These ice cream scoops ranged in price from $9.58 to $43.25 at the time of testing. Some ice cream scoops were PR samples, and others were purchased at full price, but testers had no knowledge of either while performing the tests. They took the retail price into account at the very end of the test when assessing the overall value of each ice cream scoop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After these tests, we noted each ice cream scoop’s design, special features, grip, overall performance, and durability. After rating all of the scoops, we named our top 11 and they are currently being tested at home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-cd06bb60-7a42-4445-b6c5-7bc7a13b1f6d></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are professional ice cream scoops made of?</span></p><p>You may notice various scoops or spades when you visit your local ice cream shop. Generally speaking, though, the most traditional ice cream scoops have a rubber or plastic handle for easy gripping. And the body of the scoop is likely made out of stainless steel or aluminum, so it can dig into frozen desserts effortlessly.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the standard ice cream scoop size?</span></p><p>Do you want one, two, or three scoops for your little treat? And how do you know how much you’re consuming? On average, a scoop of ice cream is about 4 ounces, though, of course, this will vary by ice cream shop and type of scoop.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What should I look for in an ice cream scoop?</span></p><p>Like any kitchen gadget, what matters in an ice cream scoop depends on the individual. But from our experience, we found that the length and material of the handle are essential. If the shaft is too long, it's unwieldy while scooping, and if it is too short, then you’ll end up with ice cream all over your hands. We also discovered that having handles made with silicone or other gripping materials allowed us to add force/pressure to scoop into more compact ice creams.&nbsp;</p><p>The scooper shape affects how the ice cream balls are formed and how easily those balls release into the bowl. And while it might seem like a trigger-style scoop would work best, we found those are better for cookie dough and batter. We found that the gap between the moving scraper created uneven ice cream balls and was more challenging to clean. In our opinion, these types of tools were better off for other jobs.</p><p>Lastly, while spades are great for commercial ice cream shops, they are not as convenient for home cooks. While they cut into the ice cream easily, you would need to shape them into ice cream balls manually. These larger scoops also don’t fit easily into smaller containers, like pints.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lindsay Tigar</a> is a freelance writer and product reviewer specializing in home, travel, beauty, wellness, and fitness products.
