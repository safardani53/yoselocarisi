However, their relationship ended after just two years of marriage;&nbsp;the couple got divorced in 1993.</p><p>A year later,&nbsp;Flay found the love of his life for the second time when he bumped into&nbsp;Kate Connelly.</p><p>Connelly, a host on Television Food Network, was a single mother of a 9-year-old son.

The settlement took five months after their separation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite all the broken marriages, the outdoors-loving chef still seemed hopeful for love as he began dating Yorke. However, just like his past relationships, this one ended as well.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Close To His Daughter, Sophie Flay</h2><p>Despite failing to keep his romantic relationships intact, Flay is quite the opposite regarding his relationship with his daughter Sophie, whom he had with his second wife, Connelly.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Sophie, who was born on April 16, 1996, is very close to her father.
