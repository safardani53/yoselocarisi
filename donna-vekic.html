Both her parents were athletes and used to be very active in sports.</p><p>Her father, Igor, used to play football and was part of a large football family in their hometown in Croatia. Likewise, her mother, Barnkica, was an athlete running in 100m-400m hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides her parents, she grew up with her younger brother Bruno Vekic, a football player and an aspiring pilot.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming from a sporting family, Vekic dreamt of becoming a gymnast when she was young and was already an extraordinarily active gymnast at the early age of six.</p><p>But eventually, she took up tennis and fell in love with the sport. Donna said in one of her interviews,</p><p>“I first started playing tennis when I was six years old. Before that, I did gymnastics for two years, and I enjoyed that. But they said that was going to be too tall.”</p><p>“I guess they were right. At my first tennis practice, I sprained my ankle, and it was super painful, but I came back the next day because I enjoyed playing it.”</p><p>Apart from this, she has not disclosed her education details in the media.&nbsp;</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Age & Body Measurement</span></h2><p>Young and talented, Donna was born on&nbsp;28 June 1996, which makes her 27 years old as of 2023.</p><p>Being a June born, her sun sign falls under Cancer. And from what we know, they are hard-working, brave, and honest at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>She stands at a modest height of 1.79 meters and weighs around 141 lb. Being an athlete, Donna takes good care of her body and does several workouts and exercises to maintain her physique.</p><p>Also, Donna looks gorgeous with her lustrous long blonde hair and shining brown eyes.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>Donna made a big splash early with her big serve and booming groundstrokes. Firstly, she played three rubbers at a tournament, including a win at Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><p>The year 2012 had so much in store for her. It was the start of Donna’s professional career, as she succeeded in reaching the final of the WTA&nbsp;main draw at&nbsp;Tashkent.</p><p>She was the youngest player to reach a WTA final&nbsp;at sixteen but lost to Irina-Camelia Begu in straight sets.</p><p>Similarly, the 2013&nbsp;season started with Donna’s participation in the&nbsp;Australian Open, where she defeated&nbsp;Andrea Hlavackova in the first round.</p><p>But in the second round, she fell to the former world No. 1,&nbsp;Caroline Wozniacki, in straight sets.</p><p>Moreover, in the Monterrey Open, Donna defeated Julia Cohen<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in the first round but later lost to seventh seed&nbsp;</span>Urszula Radwanska in the second round.</p><p>She won the 50K tournament in the Istanbul finale after defeating&nbsp;Elizaveta Kulichkova.&nbsp;</p><h3>Chasing The Championship</h3><p>Donna started her 2014 season by entering Shenzhen Open, losing in the first round to third seed Klara Zakopalova.</p><p>However, she won her first WTA title at the Malaysian Open by defeating top seed<a href=#>&nbsp;</a>Dominika Cibulkova&nbsp;in the final.</p><p>Sadly, after that, a slew of bad luck followed the Croatian tennis star. Donna was defeated in the final round at Madrid Open, the first round at French Open, the second round at Baku Cup, the first round at US Open, and the first round at Tashkent Open.&nbsp;</p><p>After a subpar 2014 season and a bad start to 2015, Donna’s ranking dropped to No. 177. She then entered the ITF event&nbsp;in&nbsp;Istanbul&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces=true>as the top seed but lost in the quarterfinals to the sixth seed,&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel=noopener>Margarita Gasparyan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, in the&nbsp;French Open, she claimed her first top-40 victory in the season after beating&nbsp;Caroline Garcia,&nbsp;Bojana Jovanovski, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Ana Ivanovic</a>.</p><p>But again, Donna lost luck in the first half of the season by failing to qualify for Wimbledon&nbsp;or the&nbsp;US Open. Later, she ended the season ranking No. 105.</p><p>In 2016, Donna participated at the&nbsp;Australian Open&nbsp;and lost in the first round to qualifier&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Naomi Osaka</a>. Meanwhile, she reached the&nbsp;San Antonio Open&nbsp;quarterfinals with a win over&nbsp;Aliaksandra Sasnovich&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Kiki Bertens</a>&nbsp;but lost to&nbsp;Tsvetana Pironkova.</p><p>Donna lost in the first round of ten consecutive WTA tournaments, including the French Open, from February to August. Similarly, in September, she reached the final ITF tournament in Saint Petersburg but lost to Natalia Vikhlyantseva.&nbsp;</p><p>However, at the&nbsp;ITF Sharm El Sheikh, she had a victory after reaching the&nbsp;year’s ITF final. Likewise, she defeated Sara Sorribes Tormo and won her career’s fifth ITF title in the final.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ups & Downs</h3><p>Donna won her second WTA title at the Nottingham Open&nbsp;in&nbsp;June 2017&nbsp;after defeating&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Johanna Konta</a> in three sets. Just like that, at the&nbsp;US Open, Donna reached the third round of a&nbsp;Grand Slam tournament&nbsp;for the first time.</p><p>Not to mention that season, Donna broke into the world top 50 for the first time in July, reaching a career-high singles ranking of world No. 45&nbsp;and ending the season ranking at No. 56.</p><p>Donna continued her success in 2018&nbsp;and reached the semifinals in&nbsp;Tokyo&nbsp;by defeating top-10 players and later completed the season ranking No. 34.</p><p>Vekic’s 2019 season started well as she climbed to the Brisbane semifinals. Unfortunately, Donna could not keep this momentum at the Australian Open, as Kimberly Birrell defeated her in the second round.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Donna-Vekic-1.jpg><p>She rebounded her loss at her next tournament, reaching the biggest final of her career at the St. Petersburg Trophy. Vekic only played two matches after losing to Naomi Osaka in Stuttgart in the quarterfinals.</p><p>Later she qualified for the second-tier year-end singles tournament at the WTA Elite Trophy for the first time in her career. Nonetheless, she finished the 2019 season ranked No. 19 in the world, her first top-20 finish.</p><p>Donna kicked off her 2020 season at Brisbane International. She then played at the first edition of the&nbsp;Adelaide International&nbsp;and made it to the quarterfinal.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, at the Australian Open, Vekic defeated&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Maria Sharapova</a>&nbsp;in the first round but lost to&nbsp;Iga Swiatek&nbsp;in the third round. After that, at the&nbsp;St. Petersburg Trophy, she was defeated in the second round by Ekaterina Alexandrova.&nbsp;</p><h3>2020 Italian Open</h3><p>Vekic started 2020 with Brisbane International, then continued her season with Adelaide International, Australian Open, St. Petersburg Ladies’ Trophy, and Qatar Open.</p><p>The 2020 Italian Open ended with Amanda Anisimova defeating Donna Vekic 3-6, 7-6(3), and 7-6(6) in Round 1 of the Italian Open 2020.</p><p>However, it wasn’t a smooth journey right then, as the exact match sparked controversial grounds which involved Donna.&nbsp;</p><p>During the first half of the game, Donna took the lead over Amanda until she caught a blister during the tie-breaker of the second set.</p><p>However, it wasn’t that at all. Before it, Amanda had missed an easy smash on match-point and even lost the serve.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, Donna lost her patience when she took the match time out and furiously stated, “Really? Now?” Most people think it was Amanda’s tactic to break Donna’s momentum and her lead. Some even went to the extent of stating she had fake blisters.&nbsp;</p><p>Donna Vekic represented Croatia at the Summer Olympics 2021 and lost to the eventual semifinalist<a href=# rel=noopener> Elena Rybakina</a>.</p><p>In 2021, she fell out of the top 100 on 20 September to World No. 101—her lowest ranking in five years since year-end 2016.</p><p>Vekic won Courmayeur Open in October, which ranked her in the top 70.</p><h3>Recent Career</h3><p>She defeated four straight top-25 players at the WTA 500 San Diego Open but lost to Iga Swiatek.</p><p>She represented Croatia at the 2023 United Cup, winning three matches in straight sets, including a victory over french player Alize Cornet.</p><p>After her performance at the Australian Open, she moved up 30 in the ranking and re-entered the top 40 at World No. 33 on January 2023.</p><p>On November 24, 2022, the traditional announcement of the successful athletes, sports teams, and sports workers in Osijek and the Osijek-Baranja County for 2022 was held in the City Garden sports hall in Osijek.</p><p>Many successful athletes attended the event, including Dana Vekic. She was decorated as the ‘Tennis Talent’ from the Osijek for 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Playing Style & Stats</span></h2><p>Vekic, as everyone knows, is an aggressive baseliner.
