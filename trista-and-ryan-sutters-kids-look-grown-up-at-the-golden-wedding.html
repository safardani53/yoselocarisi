The couple exchanged vows in December 2003, marking <a href=#>their 20th anniversary</a> last month.</p><p>“They never said it would be easy but this year was easily one of the craziest, most challenging, most unpredictable years of the 20 we’ve now spent together. Big change and heartbreaking loss tested our resolve,” Ryan captioned an Instagram tribute in December 2023. “We left a community and friends and a lifestyle – a safe harbor – for a new adventure and to make a new home. We struggled and we cried. We laughed and we loved. We did it all and we did it together, like we always have.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bachelorettes-Trista-and-Ryan-Sutter-Bring-Kids-Blakesley-and-Maxwell-to-The-Golden-Wedding-Feature.jpg><p>He continued: “You and me, hand in hand, heart to heart.

Here’s to living life and taking chances. 🥂 HIF.”</p><p>Fans watched Gerry propose to Theresa during the season finale of The Golden Bachelor in November 2023.

News after the finale aired. “And I said, ‘You need to find the person not necessarily that you can live with — of course, you wanna find somebody that you can live with — but you need to find the person that you can’t live without.’”</p><p>When it came to <a href=#>getting married on TV</a>, Trista hoped Gerry and Theresa could “just enjoy” the special moment together. “Weddings are stressful, and weddings on television are even more stressful,” she added. “So as long as you are focused on each other and come with intention, they’re gonna be great.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Thursday’s ceremony was officiated by fellow Golden Bachelor alum<strong> Susan Noles</strong> — and there wasn’t a dry eye in the house as the bride and groom exchanged their vows.</p><p>“I promise to choose you every day as the one I love and never take your heart for granted. I promise to shout the ‘I love yous’ by day and whisper them softly at night,” Gerry said. “I promise to keep you safe, I promise to make you feel comforted in difficult times, and abundantly joyful in great times. I promise in those dark, pillow talk moments when the silence deafens to share my innermost thoughts with you, and to listen to yours tenderly and carefully because we have a trust that cannot be broken.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatqpmowaJ5wKebZqqplrtuv9Stq56qo2K4qrDSZqOop5titLO71qdkrqhdlsFuwMeeZKCnnJmyr3nWnpudoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
