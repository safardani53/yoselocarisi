However, it isn’t easy to keep romantic affairs a secret when you’re a public figure and have a massive fan following all across the globe.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There have been many instances when the Hallmark hero has talked about his girlfriend and his relationship, but he has never revealed her name. Not only that, McNally posts no pictures on his social media account that sheds light on his personal life.</p><p>But it is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;that he is in a happy relationship with Julie Gonzalo, who was his co-star in the 2018 Hallmark movie&nbsp;Sweetest Heart.&nbsp;However, neither of them has accepted nor denied it.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In a 2019&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;with ET, when asked about when he feels the sexiest, the good-looking actor shied away and said if his girlfriend calls him handsome, it makes him feel good. He also revealed that the most romantic thing he has ever done is decorating their apartment, which hints towards them living together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>If my girlfriend tells me I'm handsome, that'll make me feel good.</p><h2>He and Gonzalo Share Pictures of Same Dogs</h2><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LA Times</a>&nbsp;in 2019, when he talked about spending his leisure time, McNally opened up about stretching a collapsible tent and laying down a kingsize mattress for four — the couple and their two adorable dogs, Charlie and Bowie — whenever they are on the campsite.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Just months before the statement, he had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a>&nbsp;with My Devotional Thoughts that he and his girlfriend had adopted a dog each.&nbsp;</p><p>Now,&nbsp;Gonzalo has shared a couple of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pictures</a> of McNally's&nbsp;dogs on her Instagram handle.

The first day they met, it was all about the camera, makeup, and hair testing. From day one itself, Gonzalo wanted to discuss the scenes and, most importantly, get to know each other.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>We took the time to just kind of chat and talk and get to know each other as much as we could in the little time that we had. And then throughout the film, we were able to get together after work and read some lines. And he’s such a wonderful, wonderful person and a terrific actor so it was very easy with him.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fansided</a>&nbsp;in 2018, the actress spilled beans on meeting the terrific actor for the first time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>When asked about how the two could craft the romantic chemistry, she replied they took time to chat with each other, and then throughout the movie, they would meet&nbsp;after work to read lines. She also added that she believed in the energy and space they shared and had great chemistry built organically.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, chemistry is about feeling good about the person you’re with and knowing their energy. I’m a true believer in energies and space and all that stuff.</p><p>Not only that, but she also shared a fun fact about how the pair shared cupcakes in between takes as Gonzalo’s character had a cupcake business in the Hallmark movie.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, neither McNally nor Gonzalo have ever opened up about their relationship publicly, and we respect the fact that the two want to maintain privacy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnk52%2Fqr%2BMppqnmZyhxm6zyKujn6qZmrulesetpKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
