The two ladies on the episode that aired on Oct. 20, 2019, pitched the Sharks to invest in their business.

She offered the mother-daughter team an investment of $150,000 in exchange for 10 percent equity, which was exactly what they asked for. How it came about that Kelley and Ellen ended up on the show was that after relocating to Florida, Kelley was not prepared for the mosquitoes and how they would impact the quality of life for her family, and knew she had to do something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Determined to find a solution, Kelley discovered a product that uses suction to eliminate the irritant and provide instant relief after being bitten by a mosquito and wanted other families to have access to this life-changing product.
