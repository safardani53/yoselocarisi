Thomas is now a registered nurse who is helping children struggling with similar issues.</p><h2>Holding Therapy Helped the 'Child of Rage'</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Thomas&nbsp;had been a victim of sexual abuse when she was just a young girl. She and her 7-month-old brother John were left in her biological father's care when her mother died. But instead of caring for his children, her father <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sexually abused</a> her while neglecting John. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This continued for six months until the doctors finally discovered what was happening and reported it to the authorities. As a result, social services took full custody of the two children, and they were adopted by Jill and Rob Tyler a few months later.</p><p>The situation after the adoption&nbsp;seemed fine initially, but problems surfaced soon after when Thomas' outbursts of violence and rage came to her adoptive parents’ attention.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her history of sexually and physically&nbsp;abusing John also came to light.&nbsp;Things worsened.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At one point, she even slammed John’s head against the concrete and pushed him down a staircase. She also threatened her adoptive parents that she would kill them and her brother with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">butcher knife</a>&nbsp;while they were sleeping.</p><p>Soon after, the Tylers sought professional help.&nbsp;Dr. Ken Magid got Thomas to admit to wanting to kill her family and uncovered her history. Subsequently, the doctor separated her from her family and placed her in a special home run by therapist Connell Watkins.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After multiple sessions of holding therapy, or&nbsp;"hugging therapy"&nbsp;(now a very controversial practice after the treatment killed multiple patients going through it), Thomas could bond with people and get over her attachment disorder. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Beth Thomas Is Helping Children Like Her</h2><p>The "child of rage" is now a very different person. Thomas received her bachelor’s in nursing from the College of Nursing and Health Sciences at the University of Colorado and is a registered nurse.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She is also working alongside Nancy Thomas, her second adoptive mother, to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">educate</a> people about parenting and helping challenging children.</p><p></p><p><strong>An image of Beth Thomas.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Meionorte</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Because of her own history, the registered nurse travels&nbsp;around the country to give speeches about attachment disorders and educate people on the subject.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She even wrote a book,&nbsp;'More Than A Thread Of Hope,' to tell&nbsp;her hope and healing story.&nbsp;She also managed to win the 2010 Mountain West Nurse of the Year Award&nbsp;to mentor&nbsp;her contributions to child caring.&nbsp;</p><h2>Beth Thomas 'Child of Rage' Is Now Married</h2><p>Thomas has grown past bearing the weight of her father's actions, as evident by the fact that she is now a registered nurse. What's more is that the child of rage who grew up with an attachment disorder is now a married woman.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per The Netline, Thomas currently resides in Flagstaff, Arizona, with her husband, whose identity has not yet been disclosed to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>The outlet further reported that Thomas got married on November 18, 2016.</p><p>However, because of her secretive lifestyle that&nbsp;she deliberately kept away from social media, it cannot be said with absolute certainty if she has any children of her own.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5eytbSMrZ%2BopZGoerG%2Bzp%2BcrKuZpLuiuIynrKurlWK7sMONoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
