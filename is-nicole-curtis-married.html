She also had a son with a businessman, Shane Maguire. Some outlets vouch that she had a husband, Steve Lane, at one point, but there isn't enough information online to confirm this.&nbsp;</p><p>Motherhood has always been a vital part of Nicole's life. However, her romantic partners didn't take all that well to this.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a rumor, Cimini was sent to prison in November 2016 for DUI manslaughter.&nbsp;It's understood that he had also been falling behind on child support payments for several years.

This issue was at the focal point of the custody battle — as Nicole claimed she was unable to pump enough breastmilk that would have seen Harper through an overnight visit at his father's.&nbsp;</p><p>In July 2018, Shane filed for sole custody, stating that Nicole was "not a fit" mother, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicole and Shane reached a custody agreement in October 2018. They will continue to have joint custody over the child, and they are expected to share equal responsibility and decision-making authority.</p><p>Nicole introduced her boyfriend, Ryan Sawtelle, to her followers via an Instagram story posted in July 2019.
