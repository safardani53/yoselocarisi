As they smiled for the cameras, the pair seemed to be at ease and in good spirits.</p><p>The couple’s recent red carpet outing comes after Radcliffe revealed his romance to People in March. At the time, he stated:</p><p>“I have a wonderful life. I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a decade. We’re overjoyed. I just completed the Weird Al movie, which has been one of the most enjoyable and thrilling experiences of my career.”</p><p>Daniel Radcliffe and Erin Darke met on the set of their 2013 film Kill Your Darlings and began dating soon thereafter. Despite keeping their romance primarily hidden from the public view, the couple has been together for over ten years.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Daniel Radcliffe and his GF Erin Darke walked the carpet together 💕 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/M40FnnTilH</a></p><p>— Etalk is at #TIFF22 🎬🇨🇦 (@etalkCTV) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 9, 2022</a></p><h2>A look at Daniel Radcliffe and Erin Darke’s relationship</h2><p>In 2013, Daniel Radcliffe and Erin Darke met on the set of Kill Your Darlings. In the film, the former portrayed a youthful Allen Ginsberg, while Darke’s character had a short affair with Ginsberg.&nbsp;The pair were first seen together offscreen in 2013 at the Sundance Picture Festival to promote their film. At the time, a source informed US Weekly:</p><p>“They were affectionate for most of the night.” They were a bit more visible outside the arena when they left.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Daniel-Radcliffe-1.jpg alt="Daniel Radcliffe" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Radcliffe subsequently acknowledged their connection during an interview on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen later that year. He stated:</p><p>“I am in a relationship.” And my type is… the kind I keep to myself. My type is perceptive.”</p><p>Radcliffe and Darke made their red carpet debut at the 2014 Tony Awards, drawing media attention due to their height disparity. Darke is somewhat shorter than the Lost City star, who stands at 5-foot-5.&nbsp;During a 2014 interview with US Weekly, the former child star revealed more about his friendship with Darke, saying that the actress was one of his greatest friends:</p><p>“I believe that’s the type of connection I always want to have with someone I’m dating.” You want to be best friends with that individual. In the instance of Erin, we most certainly are.”</p><p>He also told Parade that same year about meeting Darke for the first time and feeling an immediate connection with her:</p><p>“It was one of those immediate things where you’re like, ‘Oh, I really like this person.’ You just have a connection with someone, and then it becomes really simple to speak to them.” It was one of those circumstances.”</p><p>The next year, a video of Daniel Radcliffe and Erin Darke rapping Eminem’s The Real Slim Shady at karaoke became popular online, and it also included a romantic kiss between the two.</p><p>Radcliffe said in 2018 that his partner liked the beard he had to grow for his role in Miracle Workers.</p><p>“She truly doesn’t mind. Apparently, I have a soft beard that isn’t scratchy, which is a good thing. But, yes, I believe that was a little too lengthy, even by her standards.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Daniel-Radcliffe-2.jpg alt="Daniel Radcliffe" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Daniel Radcliffe told Vulture in March 2020 about his confinement with Darke:</p><p>“Because we wanted to be super-responsible and self-quarantine, we haven’t left the flat in… 11 days? We’ve never been more thankful not to have a child, or more upset that we don’t have a dog. But, in general, we are doing extremely well in comparison to a lot of folks.”</p><p>Prior to their latest appearance at the Toronto International Film Festival, the pair were spotted together earlier this year at a screening of The Lost City in New York.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqiVmrhuuM6oomahnqm8brDAp6CepF2nrqWvy6Kdn51dlrulecSroKdllJa%2FrLGMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
