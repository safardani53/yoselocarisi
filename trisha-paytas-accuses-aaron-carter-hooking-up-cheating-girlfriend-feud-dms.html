Former teen heartthrob <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Aaron Carter</strong></a>, 31, engaged in a Twitter war with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>YouTuber</a> <strong>Trisha Paytas</strong>, 31, after she claimed they “hooked up” one day after Aaron revealed that he split with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his girlfriend</a> <strong>Lina Valentina</strong>, 28. “I hooked up with @aaroncarter 2 nights ago and all I got was an unfollow 😔😔😔 I’m sorry ur dick is too big for me to take 😭😭😭,” Trisha tweeted on Aug. 7. Aaron decided to respond by exposing Twitter DMs that Trisha had sent him in 2016, in which she reached out about a potential YouTube collab. He didn’t respond until June 2017, and even called her “absolutely gorgeous” and offered his phone number in 2018, according to the unverified messages. Despite the friendly exchange, Aaron’s caption over the DMs was anything but warm.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Trisha just stop. Come on girl you’re better then this n have some respect. I get what you’re doing with your life/career but it’s gotta change at some point in your life. Let’s be real. @trishapaytas,” Aaron tweeted on Aug. 8. That triggered Trisha to snap back in another tweet, “U really gon expose DMs ? Ok here we go – why u f**king someone when ur girlfriend lives at ur house ! !??? But u try to tell me she’s not??! U told me u were single wtf.” For context, Aaron had been dating Lina for nearly a year before revealing that they had split in a statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a> on Aug. 4 (he also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> about being “single” on Aug. 7).</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Here’s the plot twist, according to Trisha’s side of the story. The “Quentin Tarantino” singer claimed they had sex and Aaron proceeded to get “back together” with his supposed girlfriend “the next day” — not only that, she claimed this happened “twice.” Trisha revealed her own Instagram DMs dated Aug. 6, in which Aaron allegedly wrote that a “she” (Trisha claims this to be his girlfriend) found the YouTube star’s lashes. “I said we booked up [sic]…Hooked up…Dead ass,” Aaron added in separate messages to Trisha. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has not confirmed that Aaron actually sent these DMs, and his rep had no comment for our story.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/aaroncarter/status/1159570387820326931</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>U really gon expose DMs ?

To take everyone’s personal experiences that they have with you and exploit them for money is appalling,” the “Aaron’s Party” singer tweeted on Thursday, adding, “SHAME ON YOU TRISHA THAT WAS MY LAST ATTEMPT AT BEING COOL WOTH YOU. BE WELL…..”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH15e49xZq2qmai1onnPmrCtmaNirqSv1KycrGWRlr%2BwuoycmKuslad6qbvOpKCnn12qvW6vx56YraGenHqotdGlnauhlaOxbrLErptmnJ2ofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
