If I remember, Annie’s last words were 'I love you forever,' and we ended the call. That was 2 am on June 24, 2008. At 6 am I was arrested. I never spoke to Annie again."</p><p>He said since the arrest the two have had zero communication, sharing: "Never, never, never. I think she made a business decision. She decided saving her career was most important. I am not bitter. You can look in my eyes. I don’t have anger but I’ve been hurt."</p><p>According to court papers show prosecutors claimed Raffaello lied about his relations to the Vatican and those top church officials commissioned him to represent the Catholic Church in the U.S. to purchase churches and monasteries and was accused of stealing $6million from real estate investors.</p><p>He admitted to 14 counts of wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy in a New York court as part of a deal struck with prosecutors and sentenced to four-and-a-half years behind bars.</p><h2><strong>ANNE STAYS QUIET</strong></h2><p>Raffaello went on of Anne's disappearance from his life, saying: "If she had wanted to contact me, she knew how to reach me through my family and my friends.</p><p>"We’d been fighting a lot, as lots of couples do, but we were still in a relationship. I was broken in a thousand pieces."</p><p id=ext-gen78>He recalled: "I was too big. I had too much, too soon and, because Annie and I were dating, I attracted attention. I think the publicity generated the [FBI’s] interest in me."</p><p>After his release, he was deported to Italy and cannot enter the U.S.</p><p>Since then he is married to Konstantina, a friend from New York, and they have homes in Milan and Athens, a 4-year-old son, Pasquale, and are very soon expecting a daughter.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p><a href=#>Anne</a>, 38, met her current husband, <a href=#>Adam Shulman</a>, in 2008 through mutual friends at the film festival.</p><p>She and the actor, producer, and jewelry designer married in 2012 and welcomed their first child, Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman, in 2016.</p><p>In July of last year, Anne revealed on Instagram that she was expecting her second child with Adam, and Jack was born a few months later in November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000666998783.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000607419080.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000666998793.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Anne Hathaway impersonates Katie Holmes</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrY2Z9eX2PaJinppVitaLAx5qumrFdmsVuvsCfnZqdnKG8brLOpaOinaKeeq%2Bx1Z6pZqugpLimedOoZKGhnWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
