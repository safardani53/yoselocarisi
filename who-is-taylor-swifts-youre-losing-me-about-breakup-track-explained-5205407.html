To find out who Taylor’s heartbreaking song is about, keep reading!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>What Is ‘You’re Losing Me’ About?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>The first verse of the song recalls a conversation between Taylor and an unknown lover. “You say, ‘I don’t understand,’ and I say, ‘I know you don’t,’” she sings. “We thought a cure would come through in time / Now, I fear it won’t / Remember lookin’ at this room, we loved it ’cause of the light / Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it’s time.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The pop star then asks herself whether or not she should end the relationship, as she sings, “Do I throw out everything we built or keep it? / I’m getting tired even for a phoenix / Always risin’ from the ashes / Mendin’ all her gashes / You might just have dealt the final blow.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Elsewhere in the track, Taylor explains how she gave the romance everything she had but still felt that it was lacking something between her and her unnamed boyfriend. Not only that, but she also points out that she wanted marriage but her former beau didn’t.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“How long could we be a sad song / ‘Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?” she sings in another verse. “I gave you all my best me’s, my endless empathy / And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier / Fighting in only your army / Frontlines, don’t you ignore me / I’m the best thing at this party (You’re losin’ me) / And I wouldn’t marry me either / A pathological people pleaser / Who only wanted you to see her / And I’m fadin’, thinkin.’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>They made You’re Losing Me on December 12th 2021. Taylor stayed in that relationship for another year after he dealt the final blow.

The former pair <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split earlier this year</a> just as she kicked off her <i>Eras Tour</i>. The “Karma” artist and the<i> Mary Queen of Scots </i>actor dated for six years.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Many Swifties have unpacked the lyrics of “You’re Losing Me” and pointed out a few that could have hinted at Joe. As Taylor calls herself “the bravest solider / fighting in only your army,” fans recalled that Joe has starred in a few war films, including <i>Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk</i>. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>As the news of their breakup surfaced, multiple outlets reported that it was Taylor’s decision to walk away from her and Joe’s relationship, which is indicated in the song as she sings, “My heart won’t start for your anymore” in the chorus.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>When Did Taylor Swift Write ‘You’re Losing Me’?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>According to <b>Jack Antonoff,</b> a musician and collaborator, Taylor composed and wrote the song in December 2021 when she and Joe were still dating. As a result of this revelation, many X users (formerly known as Twitter) alleged that the song was inspired by Taylor’s crumbling relationship with Joe.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“Taylor knew her and Joe were over all the way in 2021 [sic],” one social media user tweeted, while another wrote, “Jack confirming ‘You’re Losing Me’ was written in 2021 rewrites so much of Taylor and Joe’s history. Never getting over this breakup, sorry not sorry.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LBosXLqKlmq6ees7W%2FjLKmrqqVYrmwv8innmallWKuo7vUrWSbqpWWuLa8jK2pmpubYrK5vMuaoKedlGKCc3yUbWdwZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
