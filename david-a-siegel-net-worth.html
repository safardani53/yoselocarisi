Construction work came to a halt a few years later, partly because of the unexpected complications brought on by the financial crisis of 2007-2008. The family briefly lost faith in the property circa 2011. They listed it for $75 million — but they seemingly failed to attract the right buyers. Work on the home resumed a year later.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>"The house is a totally different house than when it was originally planned," Jackie exclusively told <a href=#>Distractify</a> in a recent interview.
