All the big names in the industry like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and Ninja go by their aliases. Most of these monikers even have a story behind them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But for YouTuber SoLLUMINATI, the name apparently has no real meaning.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>SoLLUMINATI, who started by posting videos about NBA2K and later transitioned to IRL stuff, has iterated multiple times that he is not a conspiracy theorist. His name has nothing to do with the devil, secret society, or anything remotely related to it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Is SoLLUMINATI?</h2><p>SoLLUMINATI, real name <a href=# rel=follow>Jevontay Baynes</a>, was&nbsp;born on&nbsp;October 4, 1994. Now at the <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">age</a>&nbsp;of 26, the social media star boasts over one million subscribers each on his <span>YouTube channels&nbsp;SoLLUMINATI and </span><span>SPIRITUAL So.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Prior to joining YouTube, Baynes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">played</a>&nbsp;college basketball&nbsp;at&nbsp;Odessa College&nbsp;and the Eastern Michigan University. Even his YouTube career started with basketball as he covered the content of&nbsp;NBA 2K15&nbsp;gameplay in 2015.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His height is often a topic of curiosity for his fans who ask how tall is SoLLUMINATI? F<span>itting for a basketball player, he stands at the</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span> height</span></a><span> of 6 feet and 4&nbsp;inches.&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Where Did the Name SoLLUMINATI Come From?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In a Q & A session in 2017, when a fan&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">asked</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;where his name SoLLUMINATI came from, Baynes answered it was from creativity. He just wanted a name that would stand out and be unforgettable.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The&nbsp;popular <a href=# rel=follow>YouTuber</a> also clarified his alias had nothing to do with the devil or the secret society Illuminati. Rather, he shared he believed in god.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>I am not into Illuminati, I am not none of that bro. It's just a name.</p><h2>SoLLUMINATI Has a Second Channel</h2><p>Baynes&nbsp;isn't as active in the SoLLUMINATI channel as he used to be. Instead, he is active on his second channel, SPIRITUAL So. It has over 1.15 million subscribers and 66.5 million views. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The content of the channel comprises motivational and spiritual videos, vlogs, and other challenges.</p><p>Though his second channel&nbsp;touches more on the spiritual aspect, SoLLUMINATI uses his&nbsp;primary channel to&nbsp;share&nbsp;his opinion on almost everything under the sun -â€” from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">US Elections</a>, his views on&nbsp;schools&nbsp;to sensitive issues like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suicide</a>.</p><p>Besides opinions, Baynes also shares his workout routines and&nbsp;his spiritual experiences.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>SoLLUMINATI's transition in his YouTube career from gaming to real-life, nature, and spirituality shows that his alias is merely a name and not a reflection of his contents. He has used the same name for his Instagram and Twitch accounts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6y1pr7EZpuinF2uvLbA1Jucq2WjpLmtwcyipZqsmWK0psCMoaCsZZ6WuqZ5xaumpmaYqbqt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
