She was previously married to retired NBA star&nbsp;<strong>Eric Williams</strong>, 51, for a decade and their tumultuous divorce played out on the VH1 reality show. Eric infamously threw a drink in Jennifer’s face while they were fighting on the show. They did not have any children together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jennifer went public with her relationship with Christian, an investor, on his 30th birthday in June 2023. She posted a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> out for drinks together (which you can see below) with a sweet message to her beau wishing him “peace” and “love” on his birthday.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Jennifer and Christian revealed the origins of their relationship in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> on their YouTube channel in early August. They said they met through a mutual friend on a rooftop in December. “I saw her sitting there and I was just like, ‘aw man be good,’ ” Christian said. “We were just having good conversation amongst everybody and it also felt like him and I were talking and connecting,” Jennifer added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>After connecting that night, the pair asked their friend about each other, and they got dinner at Nobu a few nights later, they said. Christian explained in the YouTube video that while he “wasn’t even in the market looking for a relationship because I just felt like it wasn’t time yet,” he simply could not resist how he felt about Jennifer. And now they’re engaged!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5FyZpuZo6Cyta7ApaNmr5mrsrR5yZ6lp6GWmr9uw8ilo6KZnah6prrGmp6enF2ntq%2BzjKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
