According to the source, the newlyweds will perform another wedding ceremony “in the near future” in Italy, inviting all of their friends and family.</p><p>The celebrities were seen outside a courthouse in Santa Barbara, according to TMZ. Kardashian, 42, was dressed in a white gown with a veil, while Barker was dressed in a black-on-black suit.&nbsp;The couple was photographed in front of a black convertible with a “Just Married” sign on the back. Mary Jo “MJ” Campbell, Kardashian’s maternal grandmother, was also seen watching the pair take wedding photos.&nbsp;This is not the first time the couple has said “I do” to each other. Following the GRAMMY Awards in Las Vegas last month, Kardashian and Barker went to the One Love Wedding Chapel in Sin City and married on April 4.&nbsp;however, it was later revealed that the wedding was unlawful since they did not get a marriage license.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Travis-Barker-3.jpg alt="Travis Barker" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kardashian commented on Instagram while sharing photos from her big day:</p><p>“I discovered these on my camera roll. Once upon a time, in a country far, far away (Las Vegas), at 2 a.m., after an amazing night and a little tequila, a queen and her lovely king walked out to the only open chapel with an Elvis and married (with no license). “Perfect practice makes perfect.”</p><h2>Kourtney Kardashian married Travis Barker in a private ceremony.</h2><p>Later that week, the California native said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that she and her partner sought to get a marriage license, but the office was closed, forcing them to settle for a practice run.&nbsp;Kourtney Kardashian also said that she informed her family through group text, with Khloé Kardashian participating via FaceTime. Kim Kardashian had this to say about it:</p><p>“I was dozing off. ‘Oh, hi guys, by the way…’ she said in the group chat. ‘Last night, I married!’ And when I woke up, I had a million messages.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Travis-Barker-2.jpg alt="Travis Barker" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The wedding occurred almost six months after the Blink-182 drummer proposed to the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum on the beach in Santa Barbara. After many years of friendship, the news site revealed that the stars were dating in January 2021.</p><p>Travis Barker previously married Shanna Moakler in 2004 but divorced the following year, with their divorce formalized in 2007. They have two children, Landon and Alabama. Barker is also the father of Atiana De La Hoya, the kid of Moakler and professional boxer Oscar De La Hoya.&nbsp;Kourtney Kardashian, on the other hand, has three children with ex-boyfriends Scott Disick: Mason, Penelope, and Reign.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirq5mmnsBursCrop6qXZa7pXnKqKyrrJ6axm63wKubmquYnq6vecaoq2alkae%2FqrHDZp2oql2ptaZ50p6aqKaUYsGqucRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
