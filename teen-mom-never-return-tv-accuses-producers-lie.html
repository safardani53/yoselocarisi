I always said no more reality shows for meâ€¦ Reality TV is what it is. It's drama. They create s**t. They want you to lie sometimes and redo scenes.</p><p>"I would never want to do that with a friend. Trust me. It's not worth it," she explained.</p><p>The 31-year-old appeared on numerous episodes of Teen Mom 2 as the wife of <a href=#>Jo Rivera</a> - <a href=#>Kailyn Lowry</a>'s first baby daddy.</p><p>Vee and Jo, 31, began dating during season four of the show, later tying the knot in September 2017.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The pair welcomed their daughter, Vivi, two years earlier, joining Jo and Kailyn's 12-year-old son, Isaac.</p><p>In April 2022, Kailyn, 30, decided to <a href=#>leave the Teen Mom franchise</a>, prompting the rest of the family to follow suit.</p><p>But the decision seemed good for the family as Vee claimed the kids weren't too fond of the cameras.</p><p>"That's another reason why [I wouldn't return to reality TV]. The kids, I would never put them in that - Isaac already hates it. He loves that we're not on the show anymore, so I would never bring that back up. And for Vivi, I never wanted her on the show anyway."</p><h2>NEW CAREER MOVE?</h2><p>Alessandra later turned the tables and asked her co-host if she would consider another route in showbiz.</p><p>The New Jersey native asked: "Would you act? Would you ever be in a TV show?"&nbsp;</p><p>Vee enthusiastically responded: "Yes, I was just talking to Jo about this the other day because he said I would be great in a Novella. I was like, I would love to be in a Novella.</p><p>"Maybe next year I'll apply for some acting positions. Maybe I can get in a movie or something. I would love to act."</p><p>Since leaving the small screen, Vee has put her efforts toward her podcasts, including joining forces with Kailyn for a weekly podcast, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baby Mamas No Drama</a>.</p><h2>DELAWARE MANSION</h2><p>The real estate agent also regularly shares photos of her life on social media and has updated fans on the renovation of her <a href=#>new $650,000 Delaware pad</a>.</p><p>The U.S. Sun exclusively reported that Vee and Jo purchased a <a href=#>four-bedroom property</a> in July, though they haven't moved in yet as it is currently under construction.</p><p>In September, Vee showed off the progress of the renovations on her Instagram Stories, explaining that they ripped out the interior of the 3,911 square-foot home and planned to refurbish it completely.</p><p>The spacious abode includes a massive kitchen and bar space and a large brick fireplace in the living room.</p><p>It also has a small workout room and a game room with a big pool table on the ground floor.</p><p>Off of their enormous kitchen, two double window doors slide open to reveal a lovely furnished patio.</p><p>The patio opens into their sizable backyard, which includes an extra buildable lot, two-car garage and basketball court.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Although, the real gem of the backyard is the in-ground pool, complete with a diving board.</p><p>Vee mentioned her kids' love for the home earlier in Monday's podcast episode, saying they're "obsessed" and looking forward to creating new memories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/vee-rivera-jo-rivera-family-746037065.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/kailyn-vee-take-look-back-614729563.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/teen-mom-star-jo-riveras-719129847.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaWp9c4CPaKuenZ5iurC5jKecr52iYr%2BmwNSrpWaspmKupK%2FUrJysZaCnvKXBwp6prGWcnrJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
