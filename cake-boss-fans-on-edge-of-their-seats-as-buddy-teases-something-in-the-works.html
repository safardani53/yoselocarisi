In June 2022, A+E Networks contracted a creative partnership with Valastro which includes a Lifetime holiday movie, as per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Variety.</a></p><p>As Christmas is just around the corner more details of their holiday movie may be revealed as Buddy and his family star in the movie. Valastro will also serve as an executive producer on the upcoming project.</p><p>Beyond that Cake Boss has launched his very own vending machines which dispense sweet treats and&nbsp;pizzas.&nbsp;In the background of the announcement post, we can see one of his vending machines. Some fans suspected this could have been a sneaky hint.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=cake-boss-business-ventures-pile-up>Cake Boss’ business ventures pile up</h2><p>Buddy Valastro first got stuck into the family business, Carlo’s Bakery, at only six years old when he would watch his dad working with the dough. Valastro took over Carlo’s Bakery as a teen after his father passed away and whilst it was never his intention to become a professional baker he is now renowned across the globe for his talent.</p><p>The Cake Boss star now runs numerous bakeries and restaurants across the U.S. However, many know him best for being a reality TV star. In 2004, Buddy joined the Food Network Challenge series and scored $10,000 in the Battle of the Brides. The baking connoisseur then joined&nbsp;Cake Boss&nbsp;from 2009 to 2017 where Buddy and his family launched to success.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Buddy Valastro (@buddyvalastro)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p><strong>WATCH CAKE BOSS ON NETFLIX NOW</strong></p><p><strong>GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TWITTER</a>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TIKTOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmba0r86vnKuxX5iurLGMm6asq12brq%2B%2FjKilZp2UnLJuu8Vmq6Gdmad6tLHArapmmaNir7aww7JkrZ2RqLK0edKopJ6smJ67qHnIp2StoJVixLC%2Byqw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
