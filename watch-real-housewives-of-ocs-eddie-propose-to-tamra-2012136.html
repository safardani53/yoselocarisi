Though she suspected Judge had a trick up his sleeve, Barney was genuinely shocked — and rendered speechless — when he presented her with a diamond and platinum sparkler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Opening oyster shells to look for pearls, Judge had Barney, 44, open one last shell — “a special one,” he prefaced. Inside was something far better than a pearl: Her engagement ring.</p><p>Getting her first glimpse at the ring, Barney laughed and then dissolved into tears. “This is my way of showing you how much I love you and how I want to be with you for the rest of my life,” Judge told her. “Will you marry me?”</p><p>Speechless, Barney slipped the bling onto her ring finger, which was covered by a Band-Aid from Barney’s recent surgery to eliminate a tattoo of her ex-husband Simon’s name. (After 10 years together, she and Simon finalized their divorce in October 2011.)</p><p>“I’ve gone through hell and high water for three years now and this is my life and it’s great,” Barney enthused after accepting Judge’s proposal. “I’m in Bora Bora with an amazing man. And I feel like I f–king deserve this. Finally!”</p><p>When the couple returned home to California, Judge made sure to make things right and ask her family for Barney’s hand in marriage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Eddie reproposed to me in front of the children [Ryan Vieth, 23, her son from her first marriage, and young kids Sidney, Spencer and Sophia with second ex-husband Simon],” Barney told <strong>Us</strong>. “And my answer was, ‘Yes, we will marry you!'”</p><p>Watch Judge’s romantic proposal to Barney in the clip above now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6arJOderOxwKVkoaelqLK4tdWeqmanlmK8pL%2BMnpudoZVivbO7z6iqnmWkpHq1rcyrmGZqYGZ%2Fcn%2BVaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
