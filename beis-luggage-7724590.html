Sleekly designed without too many frills, chock-full of smart features without getting too technical — Béis’s suitcases, totes, and duffles have been meticulously created by actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Shay Mitchell</a> with one goal in mind: “to make leaving the house an easier experience, no matter how far,” Mitchell tells PEOPLE.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since its start nearly five years ago, Béis has steadily made a name for itself as a stylish luggage brand with a penchant for good pockets.&nbsp;Mitchell’s line of functional bags is a surprising departure from the ventures started by her celebrity peers — makeup, skincare, or clothing lines are more popular pursuits among A-listers — but the You and Pretty Little Liars actor tells PEOPLE exclusively, “I have always had such a passion for bags.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It began with her obsession with Kaboodles, the colorful plastic organizers popular among teens in the ‘90s and early aughts. The Canadian actor fondly remembers childhood trips to Target, ignoring rows of lipgloss and body mists to make a beeline toward the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>toiletry bags</a>. “It would be crazy for me to have gone into any other space other than this when this is really where my heart is,” says Mitchell. “I've always loved acting, I want to continue to act, of course. But I think even if I hadn't started acting, I would have ended up here.” Mitchell tells PEOPLE that she founded Béis by sketching her first creation, the Weekender Bag, “on a cocktail napkin on a plane one time.” The question that sparked the beginning of Béis, Mitchell says, was: “If I could design my perfect travel bag, what does that look like? And what are the features that I haven't seen out there?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We at PEOPLE know something about good luggage (we’ve <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tested hundreds of suitcases</a>, duffles, and bags in our labs), so we had to test out some Béis bags for ourselves — which we did in-depth. And after trying out all of the bags’ features (including giving the hard-shell bags a few smacks with a baseball bat), we discovered that these bags go above and beyond their comparably moderate price range. Mitchell’s thoughtful eye for design can be seen in every detail, from built-in luggage weight scales to comfortable padded handles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to discover the inside scoop on Béis’s best bags and luggage.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bis-the-weekender-travel-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis The Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BÃ©is The Weekender Travel Bag Atlas Pink" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SWSSPz3395BxqjYCi5mlSYkYmKI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-the-weekender-travel-bag-atlas-pink-c7e7d143231c4ca78e07b238f2e90abc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BÃ©is</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Organization</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If Shay Mitchell could have just one Béis bag, it would be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Weekender</a>, she says. “I feel like that was my first creation,” Mitchell tells PEOPLE. “It’s the bag that you could fit everything in.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The crossbody tote has top handles and a padded, removable shoulder strap to make the bag more comfortable to carry through the airport and beyond. Our favorite thing about the shoulder bag is just how much we were able to fit in it during testing. Much to our amazement, we managed to fit everything that we’d usually pack into a roller suitcase into this smaller, soft bag. The main compartment is structured and spacious, with a padded laptop pocket and multiple smaller slots for sorting your belongings. Zippered pockets on the exterior of the bag can hold your phone, passport, wallet, and anything else you need handy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another clever feature of Beis’s foundational bag is a zippered pocket that doubles as a suitcase handle passthrough, so the bag can sit on top of your roller luggage and free up your hands. We’re also big fans of the zippered bottom compartment, which we use to keep our toiletries and shoes separate from the rest of our belongings. With so many clever features and high-end finishes, we’d expect this bag to cost much more than it does.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Weekender survived all of our crash and drop tests during testing, and our belongings inside stayed miraculously folded (perhaps due to the structural metal frame in the bag’s lining). We did notice a few scruff marks on the bottom feet after we pushed the bag off of a counter three times, but overall that didn’t detract from the bag’s luxurious feel. After all of our testing, we can conclude that The Weekender undoubtedly lives up to the hype.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Weekend cross-body<strong> </strong>| <strong>Dimensions: </strong>19 x 9.8 x 15.7 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>3.86 pounds | <strong>Materials:</strong> Poly canvas, vegan leather trim</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-beis-the-convertible-weekender></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Beis The Convertible Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BÃ©is The Convertible Weekender" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kQzTujyCbEv_K5gyJcwbNyNDKSQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-the-convertible-weekender-83d77575b9df4a5bba270e73feb00cee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BÃ©is</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Organization</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We adored the Convertible Weekender as much (if not more) than the original Weekender bag. Like its namesake, the Convertible bag has an easy-access opening with a wire frame zip that helps you locate your items faster than you would with a standard tote bag. It also has a zippered trolley pass-through which can slide over the handle of your rollaboard luggage and allows you to carry the bag hands-free.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that the bag easily fit our two-day packing list, with a removable laptop sleeve and roomy main compartment. The biggest difference between this bag and the original Weekender is the removable bottom compartment, which can be zipped off to become an entirely separate packing cube, which we found to be the perfect size for a pair of shoes and some dirty clothes that we didn’t want touching the rest of our belongings. We were able to fit the bag into the overhead bin, even when it was fully stuffed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After our durability testing, the only changes we could find in the bag were some small scuffs on the feet, which didn’t bother us at all. The bag can be carried so many different ways, but it also might feel a bit large to lug around the airport when it’s fully packed. And, though this bag is a few bucks more than its predecessor, we think it’s worth it for the removable bottom compartment and removable padded laptop sleeve. It also has the best organization of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>any weekender bag we’ve tried</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Weekend cross-body<strong> </strong>|<strong> Dimensions: </strong>19 x 10 x 16 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>3.86 pounds | <strong>Materials:</strong> Poly canvas, vegan leather trim</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bis-the-convertible-mini-weekender></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis The Convertible Mini Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BÃ©is Travel The Convertible Mini Weekender Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/v_AdZ7-BcX5UCtFUu42fUevRsoQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-travel-the-convertible-mini-weekender-bag--ac146db8dcb64b038c5636fe3c3aa70d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BÃ©is</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Organization</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though this bag is marketed as a “mini,” we found that it’s actually spacious enough for a one to three day trip. The bag opens the same way the standard-sized Weekenders do, with a metal frame that butterflies open to give you access to more of your things at once. The interior has a few slip pockets, a zip pocket, and a removable padded laptop sleeve. We could easily fit two pairs of shoes in the bottom compartment, which also zips off to become a fully separate packing cube.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only issue we had in testing this bag was with the zippers, which split after we threw the bag off a table, though we were able to reattach them and the bag was as good as new. This not-so-mini bag would make a great personal item when traveling, and we think it’s also a great size for a spacious <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>work bag</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Weekend cross-body | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>16 x 15.7 x 16 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>3.4 pounds | <strong>Materials:</strong> Poly canvas, vegan leather trim</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bis-the-expandable-backpack></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis The Expandable Backpack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BÃ©is The Expandable Backpack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7fHAQIBZ8bJlqVoU0wGGb0jjm_I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Beis-The-Expandable-Backpack-44a0d64bf776408c9d08f96567edb6ef.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BÃ©is Travel</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Organization</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A comfortable, sleek backpack is a traveling game-changer: It’s more comfortable to carry than traditional totes and distributes the weight across your entire back rather than just one shoulder. The Beis Expandable Backpack looks like a luxury backpack that would cost double its price, and it performed exceptionally well in all of our testing. We were able to fit our entire packing list in this bag, including a pair of shoes and a bulky coat, as well as clothing and toiletries.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The inside of the bag is organized into several interior pockets, including a laptop sleeve, two large slip pockets, and two zipper pockets. The backpack has even more pockets on the exterior, as well as a luggage trolley pass-through. It also comes with a nifty water bottle holder that can be used on the outside or the inside of the bag. The bag felt super lightweight during our testing, even when we packed it full, and we loved how comfortable the padded shoulder straps felt. If we could change one thing about the Expandable Backpack, we would want it to unzip all the way around for easy access on longer trips. But that’s really getting nitpicky — because we were so impressed with this bag in every other way. And, for those already on the hunt for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>back-to-school finds</a>, this bag would be a great backpack for high school and college students.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Backpack |<strong> Dimensions: </strong>13 x 15 x 5 (7 when expanded) inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>1.67 pounds | <strong>Materials:</strong> Poly canvas, recycled faux leather, nylon zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bis-the-sport-duffle></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis The Sport Duffle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Béis Travel The Sport Duffle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/I6DNXyx5FogNdseYvj4LJkfChNU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Beis-The-Sport-Duffle-3f149b9fdb2c433bac121785f190d67e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Béis</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t let the name fool you — the Sport Duffle was made for more than just towing to the gym (but you can definitely use it for that). The compact duffle looks sleek and sophisticated and comfortably fits enough things for a weekend away. We love the padded crossbody handle, which makes the bag more comfortable to carry even when we’ve packed the bag as full as it can be. The interior of the bag is segmented with handy mesh slots and smaller pockets that helped us keep the bag organized through our test travels.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What made this duffle stand out from all of the countless other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>duffle bags we’ve tested</a> in our labs is the stow-away padded backpack straps, which unzip from a hidden compartment on the bottom of the bag and clip into hidden buckles to completely transform how you carry the bag.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we were hard-pressed to find anything that we didn’t love about the Sport Duffle. If we had to find a flaw, we’d say that you may risk getting your back a little dirty while wearing the bag as a backpack since the part that goes against your spine is also the bottom of the duffle. We’ll be reaching for this bag whenever we’re headed for a long weekend trip, a quick overnight, or a cute gym sesh.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Duffle | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>10 x 17 x 8.5 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>2.6 pounds | <strong>Materials:</strong> Wrinkle nylon, recycled poly</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bis-the-carry-on-roller></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis The Carry-on Roller</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Beis The Carry On Roller" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8N6-6u_bmtYGqruvoACAXkdunJk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-the-carry-on-roller-0b5788d723544a4cbe49a5c6dbd2d7c3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Organization</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Organizing a carry-on suitcase before a trip can be a stressful game of Tetris with no winners, but the Carry-On Roller from Béis made the packing process much simpler than we excepted. Just unzip the clamshell-style rollaboard to reveal a litany of pockets and dividers that’ll delight even the most type-A packer. And, if you’re anything like us — dreaming of a more organized trip — this bag is the perfect way to get started on your journey (literally).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inside the hard shell bag, you’ll find: a detachable compression flap with two zip and mesh pockets, compression straps, a small zip pouch, and separate pouches for dirt clothes, shoes, and underwear. The bag is loaded with surprising features, like a built-in scale on the side handle that turns red if the bag weighs over 50 pounds and 360-degree spinning wheels that glided through our every test with ease.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mitchell really thought of everything with this bag, down to the telescoping handle with light cushioning to make your journey through the airport that much more comfortable. We ran into some trouble during our durability testing and noticed that the exterior scuffed up a fair amount after dropping off a table. After slamming the suitcase with a baseball bat, the telescoping handle was dented, and we had a hard time extending it again. But, if you’re not planning on taking a bat to your suitcase (and we sincerely hope you’re not), then this bag is absolutely worth its price.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Rollaboard<strong> </strong>| <strong>Dimensions: </strong>15.7 x 22.8 x 9.8 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>8.3 pounds | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polycarbonate, polyester, vegan leather, nylon zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bis-the-26-inch-check-in-roller></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis Check-in Roller</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt='Béis The 26" Check-In Roller' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/retg35oz65-gMSVGU4yB4a0OJtg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-the-26-check-in-roller-8c73ed8b16254823a863c757a880774b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Béis</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Organization</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The 26-inch Check-In Roller bag is the Goldilocks of checked luggage: not too big, not too small. The mid-sized rollaboard is, in every way, just right. The interior of the bag feels spacious, full of Beis’s signature slew of pockets and organizational features. It also comes in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">larger size</a>, which fared just as well in all of our testing, but we think the 26-inch version could hold two weeks of clothing if packed smartly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During our roll test, we thought the hard-shell bag was a great size and weight that allowed us to maneuver it easily without worry. The zippers ran smoothly, and the cushioned handle was soft and comfortable in our hands. It rolled easily over the tile and thick carpet — in fact, we found this suitcase easier to roll around than our similarly sized <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Away bag</a>. We also found that the wheels stood up to our aggressive baseball bat test, and we couldn’t get the wheels to fly off no matter how hard we slammed the bag. A small dent appeared in the bag after our durability testing, but it was almost not noticeable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now, for our favorite part: the pockets. Inside the sleek case (which comes in a variety of adorable colors, might we add) is a u-zip flat, zip pocket, PVC pocket, detachable compression flap, mesh compression straps, and a small zip pouch. The bag also comes with separate pouches for dirty clothes, shoes, underwear, and wet clothing. Compared to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>other checked roller bags on the market</a>, this one is a great value.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Rollaboard | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>17.7 x 28.3 x 11 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>10.2 pounds | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polycarbonate, polyester, vegan leather, nylon zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bis-soft-sided-collapsible-check-in-roller></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis Soft-sided Collapsible Check-in Roller</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Béis Travel Soft-Sided Collapsible Check-In Roller" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/HpOXKAVzjHUlXUQckY6fabYrGZ4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-soft-sided-collapsible-check-in-roller-0087462028854a7c9fdf47db4d762454.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Béis</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Organization</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Soft-sided bags are great for molding into smaller spaces, especially stuffing into the trunk of the car or in the back of your closet. We tested Béis’s rendition of the checked soft-sided luggage and instantly fell in love with the spacious design and ample organization, including a butterfly opening for easy access and multiple pockets and dividers to keep your things sorted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To make the soft-sided bag even easier to store, you can snap out the removable hard pads in the front and back compartments to fully collapse the bag down. The four wheels on the suitcase glide easily, and we had no trouble wheeling it over all of our test surfaces. Three handle options made this luggage easy for us to lift, and an added weight indicator on the side handle is a handy feature. If you’re looking for a checked bag that can hold two weeks of clothing but still fits in small storage spaces, then this one is a great choice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Soft-sided rollaboard<strong> </strong>|<strong> Dimensions: </strong>32 x 18.5 x 13 (6.5 when collapsed) inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>12.5 pounds | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester, vegan leather, clear TPU, steel wire reinforced frame</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-bis-luggage></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Béis Luggage</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The first step in choosing your new favorite Béis bag is figuring out what you’re going to use it for.

Then the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Convertible Mini Weekender</a> might be the best bag for you.

If you’re tight on space, then it may be difficult for you to store a large hardshell bag. Softer, collapsable bags, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Soft-Sided Collapsible Check-In Roller</a>, are easier to store.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Weight</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re planning on taking your bag on vacation, then you’ll inevitably need to carry it. One of the great things about Béis luggage is that every bag has multiple ways to carry it (and thoughtfully designed handles). But, depending on which bag you choose, some are lighter and easier to carry than others. The smaller, softer bags tend to be lighter and thus easier to carry, though the larger rollaboard bags have wheels that can glide across any surface, which helps to lighten the load.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Organization</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the things that Béis is best known for is its thoughtful organization options. Each style of bag will have slip-in and zip pockets, but some have more than others. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Carry-On Roller</a> is full of pockets and organization slots that make it easy to keep your things sorted on the go. Having an organized suitcase takes a lot of the hassle and stress out of traveling, so make sure to think about how many pockets you’ll use and how many compartments you’ll need when choosing your bag.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Béis makes bags with organization at the forefront, so it’s not a surprise that every Béis bag that we tested has slots, pockets, and sections that will delight even the most organization-obsessed travelers.
