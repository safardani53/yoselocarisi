While Ashley rocked a sexy one-piece, Mary-Kate showed off a bit more skin in a teeny-tiny bikini, accessorized by an array of boldly colored bangles and necklaces. The famous sisters were joined by Mary-Kate’s husband, <b>Olivier Sarkozy</b>, who couldn’t help but swim a few laps himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ashley-olsen-206d683e-cb0a-48b5-8045-605727e69723.jpg><p>This is the second time in recent months that the former child stars have been spotted looking impossibly cool and relaxed.

For everything that we call modern today, think about pieces made in the ’20s and how modern they looked then and now.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Ashley, who is reportedly dating artist <b>George Condo</b>, agreed that a combination of old and new trends can make any outfit pop. “Quality and scarcity,” she told the fashion mag. “You look at these pieces and you have an emotional reaction, not just because they are pretty objects, but because they look and feel different from what is possible to do currently.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGammaKueqyt055kmquYobK6ec6lqp6mXZu5osHNrWSbmaSdtq%2BzjKysoqxdl7yltcSsZKKmXZu%2ForrCnmSwbGRmhnmAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
