Thank you all for all the kind words and support you’ve given me.”</p><p>In the months leading up to her separation, Rigsby said Burke opened up to him about what was <a href=#>going on between her and Lawrence.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cody-Rigsby-Says-He-Cheryl-Burke-Talked-About-Her-Marriage-DWTS-0001.jpg><p>“We talked about it through the season — not that they were going to separate or anything like that — but they had work to do and <a href=#>that’s challenging in any relationship</a>,” he told Us, adding that <a href=#>the Mirrorball champion</a> also reached out to him before news of her divorce broke. “I think she had text[ed] me just so I knew what was up, and in case … people reached out to me about it.”</p><p>Now that she’s single again, the Peloton instructor <a href=#>hopes that Burke takes some time to focus on herself</a> and heal from the split. “I think in any breakup or any relationship you gotta take time and you gotta just feel, especially if it was a deep and meaningful relationship,” he explained. “<a href=#>You gotta just take time to heal</a> for yourself, and when the time is right [to move on], the time is right.”</p><p>Rigsby has <a href=#>helped Peloton users everywhere prioritize themselves</a> over the past few years and he’s excited to hopefully “put faces to names” with the launch of Peloton Studios New York this summer.</p><p>“The studio is going to open soon for all of our members and <a href=#>there will be a way to access classes</a>, but we’re just working out the kinks right now, and we’re going to hopefully open soon so everyone can get a taste of Peloton Studios NY,” the California native said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued: “It really just crystalizes this community that we built online and I’m just excited that people get to come to this fitness mecca that is Peloton and really enjoy their favorite instructor and feel it in real life.”</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp5SuerO1xqyZsmWRo7Fur8eeqbKkXZfCs7fEZquapJuasW6twaisrWWYmr9uucCrqaKZl5p6sLqMna6tq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
