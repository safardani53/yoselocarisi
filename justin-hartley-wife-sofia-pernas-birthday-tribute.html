She took to her Instagram Story to tell fans that any messages would come directly from her. She also included the hashtag “booked and unbothered” and a GIF that said “too blessed to be stressed” in the message. Justin’s kind message for Sofia came as Chrishell’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relationship</a> with her&nbsp;Selling Sunset&nbsp;co-star and boss&nbsp;<strong>Jason Oppenheim,&nbsp;</strong>44, was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed</a>.
