The 25-year-old beauty was the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recipient of one heck of an engagement ring</a> from her superstar boyfriend-turned-fiance <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong>, 24, when he proposed to her on Tuesday, September 1. The way this happened couldn’t have been more special as it was already a big day for both of them prior to him doing the damn thing. They were in celebratory mode for two big reasons: one, he received his Super Bowl ring along with the rest of his Kansas City Chiefs months after they beat the San Francisco 49ers in February. Two, it was quarter life realness for her as she turned 25.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>So it was the perfect time for Patrick to seal the deal. He proudly showed off the massive engagement ring he got her in a single Instagram story uploaded on late Tuesday. Brittany, on the other hand, posted how he actually did it which apparently took place at a suite inside Arrowhead Stadium. The room was filled with a beautiful arrangement of flowers with some spelling out the magical words, “Will You Marry Me?”. She also shared several posts of their loved ones’ congratulatory messages after the big moment happened.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Brittany Matthews’ stunning radiant cut diamond rivals any Super Bowl ring,” <strong>Shannon Delany-Ron</strong>, Director of Communications for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>JamesAllen.com</a>, told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “The center diamond looks to be roughly 6 carats and sits beautifully on a split shank pavé setting. Radiant cut diamonds combine the stylish lines of a square or rectangular shape with the brilliance of the traditional round brilliant cut. I would estimate the value of the ring to be around $100-150k.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Patrick & Brittany’s love story isn’t anything new. They’ve been together for a while now, dating back to their pre-fame years when they were high school sweethearts. The blonde bombshell has developed a pretty impressive resume herself outside of what her man has been able to accomplish in his own career with her own fitness company and time as a professional soccer player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patrick-mahomes-brittany-matthews-engagement-ring-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The two lovebirds also have no problem putting their PDA on display. They acted all lovey dovey with one another after Patrick’s big Super Bowl win when he was seen hoisting her in the air during arguably the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>biggest night of their lives</a> so far.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>She later shared a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo of them in a passionate lip lock</a> during their fun Mexican vacation in mid-March. They both had their impressive bodies on display during the snap with Brittany rocking a black bikini with a mesh cover up while Patrick sported blue trunks that complimented his buff body to perfection. Congrats to the betrothed couple!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH16e49rZpuqmanBorrYZqSarKSdsri%2FjJ6loJmXmrqmutNmqaKml2K9osDRopqkZZ2WtbC5xKxkqaqfpby0rctmp6GnpKR8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
