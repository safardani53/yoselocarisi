Additionally, he used to walk almost 2 miles to get to school at 7 a.m basketball training.</p><h2>Initial Career</h2><p>Sloan was like a lost child, always forced to fend for himself. However, his perseverance paid off in the end. Eventually, he became a star player leading his college basketball for Evansville Purple Aces (1962-1965).</p><p>He was titled the Indiana Collegiate Conference (ICC) Player of the Year in 1963 and 1965 and a three-time first-team All-ICC selection during that timeframe.</p><p>Not to mention, he was also chosen as the 19th overall pick in the 1964 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets. However, he remained in his college and led the Purple Aces to their second in two consecutive Division II national titles.</p><h2>Gaming Career</h2><p>Before the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Micheal Jordan</a> era, Jerry Sloan was known for his unshakable defense. Therefore, he was nicknamed ‘The Original Bull’ on their first and only division title.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sloan-during-his-college-games.jpeg><p>At first, Sloan got fourth in selection in the 1965 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets. Right after it, he got selected in 1966 NBA by the expansion team, The Chicago Bulls. It was in 1976 when Jerry Sloan retired from the game after a series of knee injuries.</p><p>Despite being only 6 ft 5 inches, his average rebounds were outstanding, with the stat of 7.4 rebounds per game, with one season having 9.1 rebounds. His average was 18 points in 1970-71, while he had 15 points over three other seasons.</p><p>As per the sources, his number 4 jersey was retired by the Chicago Bulls in 1978, becoming the first retired jersey in franchise history.</p><h3>Career Stats</h3><table><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>GP</strong></td><td><strong>GS</strong></td><td><strong>MPG</strong></td><td><strong>FG%</strong></td><td><strong>FT%</strong></td><td><strong>RPG</strong></td><td><strong>APG</strong></td><td><strong>SPG</strong></td><td><strong>BPG</strong></td><td><strong>PPG</strong></td></tr><tbody><tr><td><strong>Career</strong></td><td>755</td><td>–</td><td>34.1</td><td>.427</td><td>.722</td><td>7.4</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.2</td><td>.2</td><td>14.0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>All-Star</strong></td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>20.0</td><td>.353</td><td>.000</td><td>3.5</td><td>2.0</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>6.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Jerry Sloan | Coaching Career</h2><p>After Sloan’s retirement in 1976, he worked for Evansville but withdrew it after just five days.</p><p>Two years later, he was hired by the Bulls as a scout, which changed the post to assistant coach after one season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sloans-year-with-Chicago-BUlls.jpg><p>In 1979, he got promoted as a head coach, but he stayed in it for less than three months. He had 94 wins and 121 losses, which kick-started his work with a layoff; hence, he was fired.</p><h3>Utah Jazz</h3><p>Utah Jazz took Jerry Sloan as a scout at the beginning. For one season, Jerry did that and then coached Evansville Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association for the 1984 season.</p><p>In December 1988, he became the head coach of the Jazz and earned a successful run of 16 consecutive seasons.</p><p>He got to coach the future Hall of Famers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karl Malone</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;John Stockton, along with other players, including Jeff Hornacek,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Antoine Carr</a>,&nbsp;Tom Chambers,&nbsp;Mark Eaton, and&nbsp;Jeff Malone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jerry-sloan-during-utah-jazz.jpg><p>Sloan had led the jazz team to six division championships and ten seasons with 50 great wins. However, they lost to Sloan’s former team(The Michael Jordan-led Bulls) twice in NBA finals in 1997 and 1998.</p><h4>Jerry Sloan | Walkthrough</h4><p>Utah Jazz had a disappointing season in 2004–05 and 2005–06. However, it picked up in the 2006-7 season. By the end of this period, Sloan was one of the coaches with ten or more seasons, winning 50 or more games.</p><p>After the retirement of the long-term Jazz player Malone, Jazz was predicted to be the worst team in the NBA.</p><p>Despite being underestimated, Sloan coached the junior team without Stockton and Malone to an unexpected 42–40 record. He was then voted for the 2004 NBA Coach of the Year Award.</p><h5>The year 2006</h5><p>On December 11, Sloan had a 101–79 victory against the Dallas Mavericks. Thus, his 1,000 wins in his career made him the fifth coach in NBA history to reach the milestone.</p><p>Again, Sloan was captured by many sportswriters for the Coach of The Year award; however, he lost it to Toronto Raptors head coach Sam Mitchell.</p><h5>The Year 2007</h5><p>On May 15, under Sloan’s guidance, Jazz went for the Western Conference finals with a 100–87 win over the&nbsp;Golden State Warriors. However, they lose 4–1 to the San Antonio Spurs.</p><h5>The Year 2008</h5><p>On November 7, Jazz had a win over Oklahoma City Thunder 104–97 in a Friday night game. Thus, he became the first coach in NBA history with 1,000 wins for one team.</p><h5>The Year 2009</h5><p>In April, Sloan was named the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in the same class as his former longtime point guard John Stockton.</p><p>As powerful as Sloan was with his games, he was just as fiery as a coach. To illustrate, in April 1993, he was suspended for pushing referee Bob Delaney, and a decade later, he was served a seven-game suspension for pushing referee Courtney Kirkland in Sacramento.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Jerry-Sloan-with-Hall-of-Fame.jpg><h3>Coaching Record</h3><table><tr><td><strong>Team</strong></td><td><strong>G</strong></td><td><strong>W</strong></td><td><strong>L</strong></td><td><strong>W–L%</strong></td><td><strong>PG</strong></td><td><strong>PW</strong></td><td><strong>PL</strong></td><td><strong>PW–L%</strong></td></tr><tbody><tr><td><strong>Career</strong></td><td>2,024</td><td>1,221</td><td>803</td><td>.603</td><td>202</td><td>98</td><td>104</td><td>.485</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Signing out as a Jazz Head Coach</h2><p>In February 2011, Sloan and assistant Phil Johnson resigned immediately.

However, Sloan Stated his confrontation with the players and reported his leave.</p><p>On February 9, Sloan’s last game as a head coach lost 91-86 to the Bulls.

However, everyone was aware of the prolonged silent war that had been simmering throughout the season.</p><p>Even the Jazz picked up a big banner to honor Sloan, and Williams was doing really well on his own with maximum-salaried commitment from the Nets.</p><p>But things weren’t picture-perfect as it seemed as there were inconsistencies and controversies surrounding them.</p><p>Altogether, after seven and a half years, Williams opened up about their disagreement, stating it rose when he wanted to have another approach in the court. However, Sloan was not ready to trust anyone. Thus, it became a massive issue among them.</p><p>Well, things did end on a good note together as Williams did ask for an apology for his impatience. Indeed, the first trial wasn’t strong as Jerry wasn’t ready to let go. But in the end, they made it into an understanding.</p><p><strong>You might like to read about<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Royce O’&nbsp;Neale</a>.</strong></p><h2>Jerry Sloan | Personal Life and Death</h2><p>Jerry Sloan had a thing for antiques as he always collected antique furniture and dolls.
