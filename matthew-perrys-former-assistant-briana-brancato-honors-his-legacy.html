He was 54 years old. Following an initial autopsy, Perry’s cause of death was “deferred” pending a <a href=#>toxicology report</a>.</p><p>Authorities reportedly responded to a call regarding someone going into cardiac arrest on Saturday. Perry was found “unconscious in a stand-alone jacuzzi,” according to a <a href=#>statement</a> from the Los Angeles Fire Department.</p><p>“A bystander had brought the man’s head above the water and gotten him to the edge, then Firefighters removed him from the water upon their arrival,” a spokesperson from the department told CNN. “A rapid medical assessment, sadly, revealed the man was deceased prior to first responder arrival.”</p><p>Perry was best known for <a href=#>his role as Chandler Bing</a> on the hit sitcom <a href=#>Friends</a>, which ran for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004. Costars <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong>, <strong>Courteney Cox</strong>, <strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong>, <strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong> and <strong>David Schwimmer</strong></a> mourned Perry in a joint statement to Us Weekly on Monday.</p><p>“We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family,” they noted. “There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss. In time we will say more, as and when we are able.”</p><p>The Friends alums continued: “For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before his death, Perry was candid about <a href=#>his struggles with addiction</a> over the years, detailing his highs and lows in his 2022 memoir, <a href=#>Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing</a>. He previously opened up about wanting to be remembered as someone who “wants to help people.”</p><p>“The best thing about me, bar none, is that if an alcoholic or drug addict comes up to me and says, ‘Will you help me?’ I can say yes and follow up and do it,” Perry shared in a <a href=#>November 2022 interview</a> on the “Q with Tom Power” podcast. “When I die, I don’t want Friends to be the first thing that’s mentioned. I want that to be the first thing that’s mentioned, and I’m going to live the rest of my life proving that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKmcq6qpqHqnu9GmnKtlkajAqr%2FTmqWtZZKntqK6wGaZq5memK61u4yhpqenoqh6qbXSZqOen5GYxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
