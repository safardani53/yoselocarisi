Oh wait. That’s not right.”</p><p>The <i>Starter Wife </i>actress then panned the camera over her fellow cast members, including<b> <a href=#>Sean Hayes</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Eric McCormack</a></b>, who were all smiles as they cheered her on.</p><p>Mullally also took to Instagram to share her excitement about the hit NBC series’ first day of filming. “Tonight is our first taping and Sean Hayes got fired at the last minute,” the <i>Bob’s Burgers </i>voicer joked in the clip, alongside the caption, “#willandmfinggraceyo.”</p><p>A fan who was at the taping tells <i>Us</i>, “The energy in that room was amazing! The amount of returning staff, crew, writers and producers … It looked like one big family reunion. The standing ovation at the start went on for awhile. We basically let out 11 years worth of built up screaming. Then we did it all again once they were done taping.” The insider all said that the first episode is “really funny,” and then hinted at its theme. “If you liked the political teaser then you’ll love what they get into in the first episode,” added the insider.</p><p>As previously reported, the sitcom’s revival will air its 16-episode first season this fall and it has already been renewed for a 13-episode sophomore season. The <a href=#>reboot will also ignore the events of the 2006 series finale</a> and instead focus primarily on the main characters.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><br></p><p>“When the decision was made to bring the series back, we were like, ‘Well, we left them with kids, right?’ And if they have children, then it has to be about them being parents, ‘cause presumably it would be a priority in their lives,” executive producer/creator David Kohan told <i>Entertainment Weekly </i>on August 2. “And if it wasn’t a priority in their lives, then they’re still parents, they’re just bad parents, right? We frankly did not want to see them being either good or bad parents. We wanted them to be Will and Grace.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Will & Grace </i>returns to NBC on Thursday, September 28, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6ipJxitLOtwp5kq52kqr%2Bvv4ytpmarlal6p7vRZp2iqqOpeqWt2Gamn2WWnrmutc2gZLBsaWx%2BdYCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
