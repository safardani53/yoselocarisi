While doing an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET Canada</a>, Robert corrected the journalist, after she had pointed out that he had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>six kids</a>. “Seven, actually,” he shared. “I just had a baby.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Then, on May 11, Robert spilled some more information about his growing family. He shared the first photo of Gia on&nbsp;CBS This Morning, and&nbsp;host&nbsp;<strong>Gayle King</strong> dished on what Robert told her about welcoming his 7th child at 75 years old. “This baby was planned,” she confirmed. “They both wanted this baby. They’re over the moon. She was brought here by love. He’s very psyched and excited about it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before getting together with Tiffany in 2021, Robert had been married to&nbsp;<strong>Grace Hightower</strong> for more than 20 years. They split in 2018. Robert and Grace have one son,&nbsp;<strong>Elliot</strong>, 25, together. The actor also has a son, <strong>Raphael</strong>, 46, with his first wife,&nbsp;<strong>Diahnne Abbott</strong>, and a daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Drena</strong><strong>, </strong>51, (Diahnne’s child, who he adopted after marrying Diahnne). Robert shares his twin sons, <strong>Julian&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Aaron</strong>, 27, who were born via surrogate, with ex,&nbsp;<strong>Toukie Smith</strong>, as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Robert and Tiffany haven’t slowed down since having their baby girl. Their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first public appearance</a> after Gia’s birth was at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21. The pair got glammed up to attend a party at the movie festival, and they once again held hands as their photos were taken.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e49xZqunkpq%2FtXnDnmSnoaKkerW1xZ%2BYp7FdmLWmuoytqaKalZiubrLIpaRmnpWowarCwKVka2hiaHqxtM6tpqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
