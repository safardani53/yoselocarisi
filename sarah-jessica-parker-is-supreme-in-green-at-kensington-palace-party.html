That wasn’t a goal of ours. We didn’t spend our time mining materials for a project to do together. That never occurred to us. We were charmed, simply, by this play.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She added, “We always wanted to be back on stage, but this one had a particular kind of special quality.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Parker — who is most known for her portrayal of Carrie Bradshaw in <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> — got her start on Broadway in 1976 when she starred in The Innocents.
