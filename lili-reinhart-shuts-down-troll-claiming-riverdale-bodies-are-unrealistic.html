I have bigger boobs, I have cellulite on my thighs/butt, and my stomach sticks out rather than curves in,” the Ohio native explained. “This is still something I struggle with on a daily basis. And it doesn’t help when I’m being compared to other women.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hustlers star</a> opened up about her own weight gain due to depression over the past few months, saying that it left her feeling “insecure.”</p><p>“But I did a recent bra and underwear scene and felt it was my obligation to be strong and show confidence in myself, looking as I do,” Reinhart admitted. “And I want other young women to see my body on tv and feel comfort in the fact that I’m not a size 0. And I’m not a perfect hourglass shape.”</p><p>The Miss Stevens actress pointed out that the industry “struggles with accurate representation” of male and female bodies, which is why she is focused on being a role model.</p><p>“I commend the women who have helped our industry take a step in the right ~and authentic~ direction,” she concluded. “(Charli Howard being my favorite role model).”</p><p>Reinhart has become an advocate for women embracing who they are and being true to themselves since stepping into the limelight with the CW series in 2017.</p><p>“I have always been a huge believer in embracing one’s uniqueness and finding ways to feel good in your own skin,” Reinhart said in a press release in October 2019 after she was announced as <a href=#>the newest face of CoverGirl cosmetics</a>. “Since I was 13, makeup has been an incredible source of confidence for me and a tool that can be used to enhance the natural beauty that exists in all of us. I am so honored to partner with CoverGirl, an iconic brand that is inclusive of anyone who finds joy in playing with makeup.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Galveston actress previously opened up about her <a href=#>longtime struggle with depression</a> and body dysmorphia via Twitter in May 2017.</p><p>“When I’m feeling depressed or sad, I remind myself how far I’ve come. And how I didn’t let my depression consume me,” she wrote at the time. “To anyone out there who feels depressed or hopeless … do not f—king give up on yourself. You’re all you’ve got. And you deserve the world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaloZyeerOxyKefmqqkYsCpwdOsZJ2np6N6tb7OpaNmm5yWtq61zaBkq6Gmmr%2BlrcueZJunlJ6ytHnAq5xmrZ6nsqK4yKyroptf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
