'</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>A JUDGE has blasted a cyclist&nbsp;who killed a mum-of-two while riding a banned racing bike for "thrills".</p><p>Charlie Alliston, 20, crashed into HR executive Kim Briggs, 44, as she tried to cross a busy road in East London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

for the crash in a series of online posts.</p><p>Following a trial at the Old Bailey, he was cleared of manslaughter but found guilty of causing bodily harm by wanton and furious driving.</p><p>Today a judge branded Alliston an "accident waiting to happen" as she sentenced him to 18 months behind bars.</p><p>Judge Wendy Joseph QC said: "I am satisfied in some part it was this so-called thrill that motivated you to ride without a front brake shouting and swearing at pedestrians to get out of the way.</p><p>"I've heard your evidence and I have no doubt that even now you remain obstinately sure of yourself and your own abilities.</p><p>"I have no doubt you are wrong in this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

could have been any pedestrian.</p><p>"It was in fact Mrs Kim Briggs."</p><p>The trial heard Alliston crashed into Kim while riding his Â£470 Planet X carbon frame bike at up to 14mph.</p><p>After the crash the former bicycle courier, then 18, took to social media to describe how he twice warned pedestrian Kim to "get the f*** outta my way" in Shoreditch, East London.</p><p>He wrote: "We collided pretty hard, our heads hit together, hers went into the floor and ricocheted into mine.</p><p>"It is a pretty serious incident so I won't bother saying, 'oh she deserved it, it's her fault'.</p><p>"Yes it is her fault but no, she did not deserve it.</p><p>"Hopefully, it is a lesson learned on her behalf, it shouldn't have happened like it did but what more can I say."</p><p>He added: "It's not my fault people either think they are invincible or have zero respect for cyclists."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

took the unprecedented step of bringing a manslaughter charge due to the unusual circumstances of the case.</p><p>Jurors took more than 12 hours to clear Alliston of manslaughter but convict him of a lesser offence of causing bodily harm by <a href=#>wanton and furious driving.</a></p><p>Kim's husband Matt has since called for a new law of causing death by dangerous cycling similar to that faced by motorists.</p><p>Today he urged bike sellers and courier companies to get "lethal" bikes with no front brakes off the road.</p><p>Matt said in a statement outside court: "This case has clearly and evidently demonstrated there is a gap in the law when it comes to death and serious injury by dangerous cycling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000354036160.jpg><p>"To have to rely on either manslaughter at one end or a Victorian law that doesn't even mention causing death at the other end tells you that there is a gap.</p><p>"The fact that what happened to Kim is rare is not a reason to be no remedy.</p><p>"I would like to call on courier companies and bike retailers to get fixed wheel bikes without brakes off the road.</p><p>"They are illegal and as we have seen with Kim's death, they are potentially lethal."</p><p>Alliston's mum Karen expressed her "sincere condolences" to the family of his victim after he was jailed.</p><p>She said: "We know that they bear the heaviest loss of all in this case.</p><p>"My son Charlie whilst acquitted of the most serious charge in this case has been sentenced appropriately."</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
