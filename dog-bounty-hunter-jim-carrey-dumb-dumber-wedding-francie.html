I didn’t even know there was a date until The Sun did a story about it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cecily said she would attend the nuptials – if&nbsp;<a href=#>Dog</a> asked.&nbsp;</p><p>“If he asked me to go, sure I would, he is still my dad.”&nbsp;</p><p>If Cecily did&nbsp;<a href=#>attend Dog’s wedding</a>, it would be the very first time she would meet his&nbsp;fiancé&nbsp;Francie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She claimed: “I've&nbsp;<a href=#>never met Francie</a>&nbsp;in my life.</p><p>"I haven’t even been to the Castle Rock house since the funeral,” she added, of her mother Beth Chapman’s funeral in Colorado in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve seen my dad twice since the funeral.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cecily said her father’s engagement took her by surprise after her mother died following a battle with throat cancer in June of 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But, Beth’s daughter added, “He’s got to find his own happiness and I'm happy for him. He's got to do what he's got to do.”&nbsp;</p><p>Dog's family, however, released a statement, saying: "Family has always been, and will continue to be, important to Dog and Francie and for anyone to suggest otherwise is untrue."</p><h2>CECILY'S ARREST</h2><p>It comes after Cecily was arrested in Hawaii for domestic violence last month.</p><p>Cecily, 28, allegedly punched her now ex-fiance, Matty Smith, in the face on July 31.</p><p>'She punched him on both sides of his face and bit his upper back, leaving a mark with swelling and bruising,' TMZ reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He reportedly told police the couple had been drinking before she became "verbally and physically abusive."</p><p>According to TMZ, The Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney's Office has not filed charges, but they have up to two years to do so if new evidence is found.</p><p>Cecily confirmed there was an incident but said it was an "altercation where a man struck me and said vile things about the memory of my dead mother."</p><p>She claimed to TMZ: "I used proportional response, disabled the aggressor, and stood up for the memory of my mom. She would have handled it quite the same way, I can assure you.</p><p>"... If you put your hands on Cecily Chapman you will get your ass kicked,"</p><p>Because charges were not filed, she considered the situation "resolved."</p><h2>ON A BREAK</h2><p>Earlier this month, Cecily told The Sun&nbsp;<a href=#>her wedding to Matty Smith had been canceled</a>.</p><p>She had&nbsp;<a href=#>previously revealed her wedding date</a>&nbsp;was December 1, 2021, after getting engaged on Christmas of 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Cecily clarified that while she and Matty are not walking down the aisle as expected this winter, she said that the relationship isn’t necessarily over, as they are taking a break.&nbsp;</p><p>She added she is moving from Hawaii to the east coast, and she and Matty are “really spending time apart for a little bit.”&nbsp;</p><h2>WEDDING BELLS</h2><p>The 68-year-old reality star appeared on the podcast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Two Guys From Hollywood</a>&nbsp;earlier this month and revealed that he will be getting married on September 2nd.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dog</a>&nbsp;said during the&nbsp;intervierw: "We went to the venue and picked it out yesterday and looked at it- man it costs a lot to get married, my God...&nbsp;</p><p>"Francie's husband passed away over three years ago.&nbsp;<a href=#>Beth passed away over two years ago</a>&nbsp;and I felt very bad for even wanting to have someone else after Beth..."&nbsp;</p><p>However, he felt at ease when he learned from the bible that "God does not want man to be alone..."&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>BETH'S PASSING</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beth passed away in June 2019 at the age of 51</a>&nbsp;after a&nbsp;two year&nbsp;battle with throat cancer, while Francie's husband Bob died a few months prior to that.&nbsp;</p><p>Last September, Dog told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a>: "Let me explain this,&nbsp;cause&nbsp;this is touch-and-go.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She's not another Beth</a>, she&nbsp;ain't&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;take Beth's place."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In the same interview, Francie explained how they both helped one another grieve following the death of their respective spouses, as she said: "We could cry with each other and talk about what we were feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>"We were able to walk alongside each other through the pain and heartbreak and it brought us together in this amazing way.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000676277796.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000674965166-1.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Dog The Bounty Hunter reveals wedding date to fiancée Francie Frane two years after wife Beth's tragic death</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZWx9eYGRaJuon12XvLa607Jkoa2eqbKzecmipGabkae%2FpsWMnaymml2Zwq6uxKtksJ2Umbavs4yfqZqmk56ycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
