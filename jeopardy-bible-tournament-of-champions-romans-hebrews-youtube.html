There is no conclusive evidence that Paul wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews."</p><p>Another person posted: "Jeopardy Has it Wrong!! Sam Buttery replied Correctly in final by naming Romans as the book that Paul wrote with the most Old Testament quotes! Give Sam back his Win!"</p><p>"Is anyone going to talk about the way ⁦@Jeopardy⁩ whiffed on this one?" wrote a third.</p><p>"Hey! The authorship of Hebrews is nebulous at best. It may have been Paul, Barnabas, Apollo, or another. You need to redo that Tournament of Champions final! I love ya but yikes..." wrote a fourth.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>CNN</a>&nbsp;after being covered by&nbsp;<a href=#>The U.S. Sun upon airing:&nbsp;</a>"The statement isn’t controversial because it’s about the Bible.</p><p>"The correct answer [The Hebrews] is still a subject of debate, even among Biblical scholars."</p><p>"Experts have varying opinions on whether Paul actually wrote the letter to the Hebrews – and thus, whether the answer was actually correct."</p><p>CNN added: "Many viewers thought Buttrey’s answer should have been the correct one, since scholars generally agree Paul was the author of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">book of Romans</a>."</p><p>Paul's writing "The Hebrews" is accepted by Ken's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mormon</a>&nbsp;church.</p><p>In the past, even the show has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a>&nbsp;Paul's unknown or disputed authorship in other clues.</p><h2>EXECS STAND BY THAT BIBLE CLUE</h2><p><a href=#>Jeopardy! execs stood by the clue in a surprisingly dismissive statement</a> soon after last fall's tournament,&nbsp;saying they double-checked it with a seminarian [or student].</p><p>Showrunner <a href=#>Michael Davies </a>said: "When it comes to Bible categories, we have taken it upon ourselves as a show to use the King James Version of the Bible - as our 'Bible of Bibles' so to speak."</p><p>"And we've kind of let the world know; so for the most part, when contestants come, they kind of know that we are referencing the King James Bible."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He added: "This clue in particular, we also reached out to a seminarian who had verified that our information, as written in the clue, was correct, and that's when we went ahead and were like 'OK, we feel secure in our doing this clue.'"</p><p>If Sam had been deemed correct, he would have won two final matches instead of one, and the tournament outcome may have been different.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/distances-itself-controversial-bible-final-841523230.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/fans-demand-show-fires-writers-775960015.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaWyDcoKSaKGep6CWv6XFjJugm6SVYsGwwdGnmKadnql6sLKMnJ%2BapaCevK%2B%2FjKumppmeqHqpscGrnLCrXa68tsDUm5xo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
