"I was welcomed into this family, and it was a dream of mine as long as I can remember," she began, referencing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her Opry induction ceremony</a> earlier that year. "I didn't think this year could get any better, [but Friday] I got asked into another family!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, for the first time ever, Alaina introduced Arnold to fans. "I told him he had to come out here and we had to get a picture — we're doing it because this is the circle, and I'm going to hold my hand up and do the thing. Make some noise for my future husband, everybody!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of the many things she loves about her future husband, Alaina told PEOPLE his normalcy has been a refreshing addition to her busy, on-the-go lifestyle. She also found it rather charming that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Arnold wasn't aware of her celebrity status</a> prior to dating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's a good teammate. He's my best friend in the whole wide world. He wears a suit for work every day, and I'm not sure that he had any idea who I was when he met me. And I'm still not sure he fully does know who I am!" Alaina said. "I'm just kidding. But he's very normal. He's from Georgia like me. He's just awesome."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Lauren Alaina's fiancé, Cam Arnold.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hes-a-partner-in-a-nashville-based-insurance-firm></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He's a partner in a Nashville-based insurance firm</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Cam Arnold Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since 2014, Arnold has worked in sales at SouthPoint Risk, an insurance firm headquartered in Nashville.

The special moment was made even more sentimental because it also marked the first time Alaina publicly introduced Arnold to the world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was a night I will never forget. I got to celebrate the best year of my life. I became a member of the Opry family in February, so I thought they should be the first to know I had been asked to be in another family as well," Alaina told PEOPLE at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is the first time I'm showing Cameron to the world. He has and will continue to be a sacred piece of my life," she noted, before explaining why she purposely kept their relationship out of the spotlight. "He keeps me grounded and gives me a piece of a normal everyday life that I didn't have before him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Getting Good" singer confirmed to PEOPLE that she and Arnold had been secretly dating for the last two and a half years.

"I didn't want anyone in the industry at all. And boy, I got everything I could have ever wanted," she said about her fiancé.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking with PEOPLE in 2020, Alaina shared that moving forward, she would <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>no longer be posting about her love life</a> on social media unless she was in a serious relationship. The singer-songwriter joked that unless she heard wedding bells in their future, they probably wouldn't be on her grid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm going to be 100 percent sure that it's going to work out before I go broadcast anything," Alaina said at the time.

In fact, a few years back, she gave Pardi permission to "vet all the boyfriends" after he caught her then-boyfriend in a lie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not too long after, Alaina began dating Arnold, and Pardi was amongst the first people to meet him. "I made Jon meet him, and he likes him, so we're good!" Alaina shared. "I've just never posted about him or anything because he's just mine. He's just a regular guy. He's a business guy, goes to work every day in a suit. He's a normal guy.

In a video posted to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>, Alaina gave fans an inside look at the celebration, which boasted a champagne fountain, "His & Her" signature cocktails and personalized black napkins that read "Let's Ring in the New Year.
