Stallone responded by noting that his estranged wife “hired counsel to represent her and agreed to pay them their legal fees.”</p><p>The Rambo star agreed to Flavin’s petition to legally change her surname back to her maiden name and agreed that their union was “irretrievably broken.”</p><p>Flavin confirmed her split from Stallone after news broke that she <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> earlier this month. The pair tied the knot in May 1997 after meeting in 1988.</p><p>“I’m sad to announce that after 25 years of marriage I have filed for divorce from my husband Sylvester Stallone,” the 54-year-old model <a href=#>told People in a statement</a> on Wednesday, August 24.</p><p>She explained, “While we will no longer be married, I will always cherish the more than 30-year relationship that we shared, and I know we are both committed to our beautiful daughters.”</p><p>The businesswoman — who shares daughters Sophia, 25, Sistine, 24, and Scarlet, 20, with <a href=#>the Creed star</a> — concluded by requesting “privacy for our family as we amicably move forward.” (Stallone also shares sons Seargeoh, 43, and Sage, who died in 2012 at age 36, with ex-wife <strong>Sasha Czack</strong>.)</p><p>The Los Angeles native’s petition for “dissolution of marriage and other relief” was submitted to a Palm Beach County, Florida, courthouse shortly after Stallone <a href=#>raised eyebrows by changing his tattoo of Flavin’s face</a>. He recently covered the ink on his bicep with an image of his dog from Rocky, a bull mastiff named Butkus.</p><p>“I love my family,” a rep for Stallone told Us Weekly on Wednesday in a statement on his behalf. “We are amicably and privately addressing these personal issues.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though they decided to go their separate ways after more than two decades of marriage, the former couple <a href=#>still plan on working together.</a></p><p>“The Stallones are presently filming a reality show together, which will debut on Paramount+,” a rep for the Creed II actor told Us following the news, also confirming that Stallone covered up his tattoo dedicated to his estranged spouse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGassZyrsrTAxKtkrKyRobmwusRmm56mmZrAbrDEqaOerJmjtG65wKugrZmcYq60v8StqmaZnZ6xbrDIr6arm5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
