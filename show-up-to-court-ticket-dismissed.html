I showed up to court the first time, they said ‘OK do you want [a] trial by jury, trial by judge, do you want to pay the ticket, or do you want to do defensive driving?’”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Trinity ultimately opted to take her case to court to be heard in front of a jury three months later. Lo and behold, Trinity lucked out and avoided breaking the bank altogether just by showing up.</p><p>“This morning, I walk into the courthouse, I sit down, we do the little check-in things, [the judge is] issuing warrants. Mind you, if you didn’t show up, she’s issuing warrants,” Trinity recalled.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When it was Trinity’s time to go in front of the judge, she got some good news.
