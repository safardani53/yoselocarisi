The “Middle” songstress, who dazzled in a sequined black gown, could be spotted cheering in the audience after losing to <a href=#><strong>Luke Combs</strong></a> for Album of the Year.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The “Highwoman” singer first revealed that she may not show up to country’s biggest night during an interview with the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> in September.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I’m very honored that my record is nominated. <a href=#>But I don’t know if I feel [at] home there right now</a>,” she explained. “So many people I love will be in that room, and maybe I’ll make a game-time decision and go. As of right now, though, I don’t feel comfortable going.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While Morris’ third album,&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Humble Quest</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>, nabbed a nomination for AOTY, the Texas native wasn’t sure if the awards show was a place she would feel welcome.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Some nights are fun. Others I’m just crawling out of my skin,” she shared. “I’m not good at those events because I’m awkward. But this time I kind of feel peaceful at the notion of not going.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Reservations from Morris surrounding the CMAs began less than a month after the Grammy winner slammed Brittany, 33 — who is married to country singer <a href=#><strong>Jason Aldean</strong></a> — for transphobic remarks.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I’d really like to thank my parents for not changing my gender when I went through my tomboy phase,” the YouTuber wrote via Instagram in August alongside a makeup tutorial video. “I love this girly life.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Brittany later <a href=#>doubled down on her comments</a>, arguing that parents shouldn’t allow their children To transition until they are legal adults. “Love is protecting your child until they are mature enough as an adult to make their own life decisions,” she captioned her Instagram Story at the time.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Morris, for her part, <a href=#>subsequently slammed the beauty blogger</a>&nbsp;via Twitter, writing, “It’s so easy to, like, not be a scumbag human? Sell your clip-ins and zip it, Insurrection Barbie.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The next day, Morris once again took to social media to remind LGBTQ+ youth that they have support. “I am so sick of looking at absolute horses—t on the internet and people getting away with it, much less celebrated for it,” she said of the North Carolina native’s latest comments.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In September, Brittany made an appearance on</span>&nbsp;<span class=x_ContentPasted0>Tucker Carlson Tonight&nbsp;to address her previous remarks. When the host, <a href=#><strong>Tucker Carlson</strong></a>,</span><a class=x_ContentPasted0 href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-safelink=true data-linkindex=0><b>&nbsp;</b></a><span class=x_ContentPasted0>introduced her, he called Morris a “lunatic” and a “fake country music singer.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The “Bones” singer, meanwhile, <a href=#>released a T-shirt in retaliation with the phrase</a> “lunatic country music person” embellished on the front, stating that all proceeds would go toward non-profit Trans Lifeline and GLAAD’s Transgender Media program.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Last month, Morris took her new “label” one step further and reclaimed the title while sharing her take on the Spirit Halloween costume meme.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Lunatic Country Music Person,” <a href=#>read the mockup of the costume design</a>, which featured a photo of Morris performing. The fake ‘fit, which Morris shared via Instagram, comes with a “Tambourine, inclusive fans, pickleball paddle [and] beef with transphobes.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“S P O O K Y 🕷 S Z N,” Morris captioned the meme, which added the disclaimer, “Tall guy not included” — referring to husband <a href=#><strong>Ryan Hurd</strong>.</a></span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Morris tied the knot with Hurd, 35, in 2018 and the couple share 2-year-old son Hayes. The California native came to his wife’s defense after Morris initially spoke out against Brittany in September, saying he was “proud” of the “My Church” artist for sticking up for the queer community.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Getting a lot of people telling me our career is over, as if the last time she spoke up about something it disappeared,” he wrote via Twitter at the time. “Honestly, we’re pretty OK over here. Tours are good, got a 2-year-old we love, we’re f—king fine and I promise she isn’t going to shut up now.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacpZGoenN8kWtkppmimrtuuc6rqaKrXZbBtbHNnapmmZ2esW6u0aKrrZmernqiuMOemKdllKeurq2O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
