Heat the Streets led by Kensa, is connecting 250 homes in the village of Stithians to their very own heat pump grid."</p><p>Max added: "This is a world first and I feel quite privileged to be the project manager that's leading this engineering project.</p><p>"You feel like you're making a difference and you feel like you're having a positive impact on what's going on in the world.</p><p>"Climate change is something I am very passionate about and it's definitely what led me to this job."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>But taking to Twitter, one Countryfile fan raged: "I gave #countryfile another try tonight but only lasted 5 minutes. Sick of hearing the BBC trying to indoctrinate us all about effing climate change."</p><p>Another added: "I remember when #countryfile was about farming and rural matters."</p><p>A third tweeted: "Let it be said #Countryfile has long been #Towniefile. Biased BBC. #Climatechange rammed down your throat at every opportunity."</p><p>Others went into more detail as to why the segment annoyed them so much.</p><p>One wrote: "#countryfile what a con! I am all for reducing impact on the planet but I just googled how much ground source heat pumps cost to install - between £12000 and £45000 and the government think 6k grant would help haha but what an absolute disgrace."</p><p>Another raged: "Pushing c****y (cold) heat pumps. Some of the young people flogging them are waffling and mumbling about climate change but don't seem to have a clue what they are talking about.</p><p>"Also trying to sell useless insulation - leading to damp homes. S** off. #countryfile #scam."</p><p><strong>Countryfile airs on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpibn1zf5NqZpynpaPBs8XFoqOeZZaWu7R50rCgrZuYYrynsoybmZxlo5iurrnIp55mmaWZtqa6wp5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
