I got the top in a 34DD and then I got the pants in a 10.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve always hated cupped bikinis. I don’t know why, I’ve just always hated them.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“Since having my boobs done, I’ve really struggled to find nice bikinis for bigger busts…but this feels really comfy.</p><p>“It feels really nice, it feels very supportive, and do you know what? The bottoms are a 10 but I feel like I could have got away getting an 8.&nbsp;</p><p>“But I quite like it. This one’s a win from me.”</p><p>Next up, Regan shares her thoughts on the Brown Leopard Print Hoop Detail Swimsuit, priced at £12.50, which she picked up in a size 10.&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel like it’s really flattering like it’s got really good tummy control. I usually have a bit more of a pooch here.&nbsp;</p><p>“Do you see what I mean about the no arse? It’s not really doing me any favours there, but I feel like it’s really nice.”</p><p>The fashion fan also tried the viral G21 Lime Green Cut Out Blazer Dress, priced at £32, adding: “I love the colour of this. Like I’m obsessed with the colour of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“And makes my boobs look fantastic.&nbsp;</p><p>“However, I feel at £32, it was a tad too pricey. I think you could have got it off <a href=#>Shein</a>… or even <a href=#>PrettyLittleThing</a> for a lot cheaper.&nbsp;</p><p>“But it’s nice, I got a 10. I feel like it’s nice but it’s not flattering. It’s not one of my favourite things I have bought.</p><p>“I’m liking the bikini with the camel toe a bit more than this.”</p><p>However, the next dress, the G21 Green Blur Print Satin Midi Dress, was a hit with the content creator, who bought the £18 dress in a size 10.&nbsp;</p><p>“Right, I love this one. I really do love this one. £18 from the G21 section.&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel like it shows a nice bit of skin here but not too much… however the print does put me off a little bit.&nbsp;</p><p>“It looks like I’ve got a water stain on my car seat. Are you getting the vibe I’m on about?</p><p>“I feel like even with a nice little belt, I feel like that would be nice.”</p><p>She added: “I like this one, this one’s a winner.”</p><p>Fans loved her bargain finds, with the video gaining more than 4,200 likes and 38,100 views.&nbsp;</p><p>In the comments, TikTokkers shared their reactions, with one writing: “The second dress yesssss.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“Keep that lime dress it is 10/10,” commented another.&nbsp;</p><p>A third added: “Your Asda is well better than ours none that in my Asda.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FrZ3FxYWyDcK%2FLqKuhnaNitKa70aCcZpmjma5uvM6pp6Kml2K%2FtrnOrqmsZZSnsrS%2FjKyrnpmcZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
