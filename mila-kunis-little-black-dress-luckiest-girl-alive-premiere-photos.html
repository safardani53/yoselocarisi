However, she did pose for photos with various of her co-stars, including&nbsp;<strong>Chiara Auerlia</strong>, who plays the younger version of her character in the film.&nbsp;Luckiest Girl alive is the film adaptation of&nbsp;<strong>Jessica Knoll’s</strong> 2015 book of the same name, and will be released on Netflix on Oct. 7.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mila-Kunis-Plunging-Mini-Dress-Film-Premiere-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>In the movie, Mila plays&nbsp;<strong>Ani Fanelli</strong>, a woman living in New York City who seems to have it all but is haunted by a tragedy from her past. That past threatens to ruin everything that Ani has made for herself when she’s asked to take part in a documentary at her former high school. The movie also stars&nbsp;<strong>Finn Wittrock, Connie Britton, Scoot McNairy,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer Beals</strong>, amongst others.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In addition to&nbsp;Luckiest Girl alive, Mila will also have a role on&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>That 90s Show</a>, which is a reboot based off the show she used to star in, That 70s Show. Mila and Ashton <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actually met</a> on the set of the comedy series in the 90s, although they didn’t get together romantically until years later. The two started dating in 2012 after splitting from their former partners, and were engaged by August 2014. Ashton and Mila tied the knot in July 2015 and now have a daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Wyatt</strong>, 7, and son, <strong>Dimitri</strong>, 5.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Ashton and Mila are very much in the public eye with their relationship, they have done their best to keep the children out of the spotlight. Mila actually doesn’t even have an Instagram page, and Ashton does not post the children on his own social media. However, the family is often seen together on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>low-key outings</a> caught by paparazzi.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5JpZqahnJZ6rMHNoqpmpJmpwa2xjJujmpubYrGzsdKsZKWtk6C2pr%2FTZp6iqpxirq211Z5kqaqVoramvsRmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
