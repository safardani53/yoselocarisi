The 52-year-old&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mob Wives&nbsp;</a>star allegedly hit a parked car, as she drove through Staten Island just after 10 p.m. She’d told police that she’d taken Adderall before driving her car. NYPD confirmed that she was arrested in a statement to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.&nbsp;</strong>“Renee Graziano was arrested for a DWI on January 4 at 22:35. She’s still being held at the 123rd precinct,” they said in a statement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>After Renee got out of her car, she allegedly showed signs of impairment, including slurred speech and watery eyes. The reality star was reportedly taken to a hospital, and then to the police precinct, where she was charged with operating a vehicle while impaired by drugs, which is a misdemeanor, according to DailyMail.&nbsp; <strong>HollwoodLife&nbsp;</strong>reached out to a representative for Renee for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/renee-graziano-arrested-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Other&nbsp;Mob Wives&nbsp;stars have fallen into some legal trouble in recent years. One of Renee’s former co-stars&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Drita D’Avanzo</strong></a> was arrested back in 2019 after an NYPD raid on her Staten Island home, after obtaining a search warrant. The police found two guns, as well as marijuana and pills during the investigation. They arrested Drita and her husband&nbsp;<strong>Lee.&nbsp;</strong>After Drita’s arrest, Renee <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoke out</a> and mentioned that no matter what their relationship was she didn’t want to see her co-star arrested. ““No Matter Whether I’m On Good Terms With Someone Or Not I’d NEVER Wish Nor Want To See Anyone Go To Jail!! Especially A Mother!” she said in an Instagram post at the time. “This Is A Shame And I’m Sure It Will Be Rectified Quickly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Renee starred in all six seasons of&nbsp;Mob Wives,&nbsp;which ran from 2011 to 2016. After the series ended, she was cast on&nbsp;Celebrity&nbsp; Big Brother 18, which she came in third place on. She’s the daughter of former Bonanno crime family consigliere&nbsp;<strong>Anthony Graziano</strong>, who served time in prison from 2003 to 2011 on racketeering charges. She was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married to ex-mobster</a>&nbsp;<strong>Hector Pagan Jr.,&nbsp;</strong>who gave evidence to the DEA, which led to Renee’s dad’s arrest. In 2014, Renee’s ex-husband was sentenced to 11 years for murder.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49uZqankmLEqsLErGSrnZ6asm6z0ZqxopmepHqivtGeqq2dlGKwor6MnKmaq5hk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
