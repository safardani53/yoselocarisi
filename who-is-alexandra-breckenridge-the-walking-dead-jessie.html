Where You Know Alexandra From</h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>So, you’re sitting there watching The Walking Dead and you think to yourself, “Wow, this Jessie girl looks awfully familiar.” Of course she does! You’ve seen Alexandra — as a redhead — on not one, but two seasons of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Horror Story</a>. She played the seductress version of Moira, the housekeeper, on Murder House (season one). Then she&nbsp;appeared on American Horror Story: Coven (season three) as Kaylee, a witch who decides not to join the house. Later in the season we see her having an affair with Hank, Cordelia’s (<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sarah Paulson</a></strong>) husband, before he kills her. Eek!</p><h3>2.)&nbsp;She’s Connected To Katy Perry</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>So, how is an actress on&nbsp;The Walking Dead connected to international pop star <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Katy Perry</a></strong>? Easy! Her husband, <strong>Casey Hooper</strong>, is Katy’s lead guitarist. How cool is that? (FYI: Alexandra and her husband married in 2015.) Okay, be honest fellow The Walking Dead stars… you totally ask Alexandra for concert tickets, don’t you?</p><h3>3.)&nbsp;Alexandra Loves Photography</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Acting isn’t the only thing Alexandra is good at! She’s also a dedicated and talented photographer. You can see samples of her incredible work on her official site, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AlexandraBreckenridge.com</a>. Not only does she love to photograph skylines and atmosphere, but she also has a real knack for doing personal portraits and black and white shots. Just wait until you see some of her amazing shots! She often posts some of her photography on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, but right now it’s pretty overwhelmed with all of her Walking Dead convention shots — which we ALSO love!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>[jwplatform wr5gCe31]</p><h3>4.)&nbsp;She’s Related To An ‘NCIS’ Actor</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Acting runs in the family, apparently! Alexandria’s uncle, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Michael Weatherly</a></strong>, who plays&nbsp;Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo on NCIS. Awesome!</p><h3>5.) Alexandra Has A Bunch Of Tattoos</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Even though we don’t see them often on camera, it turns out that Alexandra has a few gorgeous tattoos that she loves. One quick search on Google Images shows that she has a decorative N behind her right shoulder, as well as what appears to be a fairy on the back of her right calf. There is also a third tattoo on the top of her left arm which is a minimalist swirl that is likely a symbol for something important to Alexandra.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — Are you a fan of Jessie on The Walking Dead?
