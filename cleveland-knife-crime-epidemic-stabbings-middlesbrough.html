"He was a gentle, decent young man with his whole life ahead of him and that was taken away in the most horrifying way.</p><p>"My family is living day to day and we're looking after each other, keeping ourselves busy and occupied.</p><p>"But I feel in so many ways that my life as I knew it ended that day, it's something you learn to live with but you can never get over."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000749520015-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000749519984.jpg><p>The aftermath for Lindsey has been shattering.

You shouldn’t be scared because they are always with you and they live in a safe place called heaven.”</p><p>"It was devastating to read those words from Shae because they came from a little boy who had suffered so much,” Lindsey says.</p><p>"He lost his big brother and the uncle who was like a father figure and he put it so simply and so beautifully that it broke my heart.</p><p>"If reading the words of a little boy who lost two people he loved because someone chose to use a knife doesn't deter people from carrying them, then nothing will."</p><h2><strong>Tougher sentences</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000749520329.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000720621375.jpg><p>Shelly Butler, 44, is another grief-stricken Teesside mother pleading for an end to the knife-crime madness.</p><p>Her daughter Toni, 25, was killed in a knife attack by another young woman in Thornaby, and in the aftermath Shelly launched a petition demanding tougher sentences.</p><p>Toni's killer Keegan Barnes, 28, was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for eight and half years in March.</p><p>"Toni's death has destroyed us and the evil creature who killed her will be out of jail within four years,” says Shelly. “What kind of deterrent is that to someone carrying and using a knife?</p><p>"My two youngest children are in counselling, they have been distraught since they lost Toni.</p><p>"My eight-year-old daughter is petrified to be in the house on her own now and her brother, who is 12, is struggling to cope.</p><p>"He broke down one day and said to me: 'my big sister loved me, why did she leave me?

They have nowhere to go because the local authority slashed youth services and put them on the street corners.</p><p>"You have youth centres asking £25 per child for a trip to Flamingoland. If you survive on Universal Credit as so many do, you can't begin to afford that.</p><p>"So what do they do? They gather on street corners and read grown adults on social media calling them scum because of that.</p><p>"They are full of anger and torment and resentment. There's no such thing as a bad kid but the lack of opportunities in this part of the world is having a devastating effect on these young people.</p><p>"That's why we are out there talking to them and educating them and going into schools to tell them about the devastation of being left behind when the boy you loved so much is suddenly taken away.</p><p>"Every morning I wake up in yesterday, to the time before Chris was murdered. That never changes, but I've been trying to channel my energy into making a difference."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000745331614.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000749520242-1.jpg><p>Theresa has worked tirelessly since 2005 to spread the anti knife crime message, firstly in schools in South Yorkshire and later back on Teesside.</p><p>Her latest initiative is to circulate "stab packs" with the help of funding from Cleveland's Police and Crime Commissioner.</p><p>Students at Stockton's Riverside College have volunteered to fill over 1,000 of the packs with lifesaving equipment to staunch blood loss and deliver mouth to mouth.</p><p>In doing so they have learnt a valuable lesson in life saving - and also the lethal capacity of a knife blade.</p><p>"You can see that it made them think and so many of those young people asked if they could take a pack home,” says Theresa. “That's where we want them, in the pockets and handbags of young people where they can save lives.</p><p>"Of course it's terrible that we have to do this, that knives are carried around as fashion accessories, but we have to be realistic and save as many young people as we can reach.”</p><p>Theresa has been joined in her campaign for a specialist Violence Reduction Unit in Cleveland by Barney Green, a surgeon at James Cook Hospital.</p><p>He played a major role in the Government's decision to now grant more funding to Cleveland Police's Crime Reduction Unit.</p><p>He said: "The strain in resources is key. If an individual is brought in by ambulance with police escorting, goes through A&E and needs theatre treatment, you are talking about a £20,000 cost for that episode if you take aftercare into account.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's also very clear that sewing someone up does not get rid of the problem, but getting in at the grass roots level just might.</p><p>"We need to educate kids about the devastation and damage a knife injury does to a body and those around the victim."</p><p>Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner Steve Turner says he had “long been aware” of the problems of knife crime in Cleveland, and that his team lobbied hard to receive the funding for the new violence reduction unit.</p><p>He adds: “We are already targeting some of the area’s most violent wards with more action to come as we refine and target the hotspots where we can have the biggest impact.</p><p>“The long-term key to stopping this culture of violence is to get upstream of any violent, criminal or anti-social behaviour and try to channel young people’s energies into more positive activities.</p><p>“It’s too simplistic to think we can arrest our way out of this problem, we must take a long-term, strategic view, whilst still making an impact in the here and now.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“We have already invested in organisations like the Chris Cave Foundation to make young people aware of the consequences of carrying a knife&nbsp; and we are funding training to give young people the confidence to be active bystanders.</p><p>“That means they can tackle their peers when they see them carrying a blade and tell them to put down their weapon.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000749520274-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000749520095-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoZ0f5Fvb3Fnk6Gyt7HLmqWdZZujtqexjJypoqWVYrKxtcOepKKbXajBoq7BoqWgq12itqWwy56qm6qfqrSpew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
