She has shown some promise over the smaller obstacles, including when second at Worcester and third at Market Rasen. But Fry has made the right call in sending her over fences after just three hurdles runs. She has plenty of scope to jump a fence and the challenge of the bigger obstacles can help with the keenness she has shown in her races.</p><p><strong>SOLDIER OF DESTINY (2.00 Catterick, nb)</strong></p><p>Jamie Snowden has been in excellent form all season and this seven-year-old signed off his last campaign with a close second at Huntingdon. Despite being an experienced horse — with two chase wins to his name — he is allowed to run in the novice hurdle ranks. He has shown his best form over this distance and has performed on more undulating tracks too so should be fine with Catterick’s rollercoaster ride. Anything close to his best form would be good enough to win this.</p><p><strong>BRING THE ACTION (12.20 Wincanton, treble)</strong></p><p>Ran his best race for a long time when second at Doncaster 17 days ago. He appreciated the test of stamina on Town Moor and that staying power will be an asset at tough Wincanton. Nigel Hawke’s gelding continues to come down the weights and is now 7lb lower than his last win. Regular pilot Tom Buckley can ride him in this conditionals’ race and he should go close again.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only. £/€10 min stake (if EW then min £/€10 Win + £/€10 Place).
