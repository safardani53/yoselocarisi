So messed up.”</p><p class=p1>Britney claimed in her <a href=#><i>The Woman in Me </i></a>memoir, which came out last month, that <a href=#>she realized she “realized [she] never wanted to see” her family again</a> after they tossed her childhood toys. In the book, Britney alleged that she visited her mom in Louisiana during the coronavirus pandemic after her relatives seemingly stopped answering phone calls.</p><p class=p1>During the visit, Britney discovered that her beloved Madame Alexander doll collection — which she had received when she was a child — was thrown away, along with multiple years’ “worth of my writing” and meaningful original poetry.</p><p class=p1>Lynne, however, has <a href=#>denied her eldest daughter’s claims</a> and asserted that all the dolls are still in her possession.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/britney-spears-tells-mom-lynne-she-doesnt-want-lost-doll-collection-inline.jpg><p class=p1>“I’m not sure who told you I got rid of your dolls and journals, but I would never do that!” Lynne — who shares Britney and her siblings, <a href=#><strong>Bryan Spears</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong></a>, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Jamie Spears</strong></a> — wrote via Instagram on Thursday, November 9. “That would be cruel because I know how much they mean to you.”</p><p class=p1>Lynne uploaded several photos of the dolls in question as further proof. “They are special to me too because of the years we spent collecting them,” she added. “Of course, I still have your things, and I am happy to send them to you if you’d like me to. Please let me know and know how much I love you!”</p><p class=p1>On Saturday, Britney revealed that she has no interest in receiving the dolls. “Nope, I don’t want them,” the Grammy winner concluded her Instagram note. “Keep it all. I honestly don’t care anymore … honestly though.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The message was included in the footnotes of a gushing post about <a href=#>Britney’s first experience meeting Swift</a>, now 33. “During my <i>Oops</i> <i>[I Did It Again] Tour</i>, I got a knock at my door,” Britney recalled. “My good friend at the time was the assistant to my manager who was trying to become a manager himself. There was a knock, and then he said, ‘I have a girl named Taylor who wants to come in and sing for you.’ I was, like, ‘Of course!!!’”</p><p class=p1>Britney remembered that <a href=#>Swift sang a “beautiful song with her guitar”</a> and was blown away by her “unbelievable” talent. Britney added,&nbsp; “We took a picture, and she then became the most iconic pop woman of our generation. Kinda cool <a href=#>she plays stadiums</a>, and I prefer her videos over movies any day. She’s stunning!!!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHq1sculqmaln6J6rcXNp5xmq5iaeqW7xKylrWWnlru1ecuoqq1llKS5rXnCqKOlnZOptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
