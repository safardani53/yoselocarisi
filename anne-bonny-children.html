Calico Jack and the rest of the crew got busted in 1720. Anne survived the consequent trial because she was pregnant. Did she raise any of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">children</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, did Anne Bonny have children? If so, what happened to them?</h2><p>Calico Jack's crew fell apart in 1720, after they got caught by the authorities. He and four other men were hanged at Gallows Point in Port Royal on Nov. 18, 1720. Anne was sent to prison alongside fellow pirate Mary Read (aka Mark Read) in the same year.&nbsp;</p><p>Mary died in prison on April 28, 1721. She was likely buried in St. Catherine Parish, Jamaica. As some believe, Anne returned to Charleston, S.C., where she found a new man, settled down, and gave birth to several children.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The accuracy of the above-mentioned tale remains contested. There's little information available about what happened to Anne after the 1720 trial. Some outlets put down the date of her death to 1733. Others claim she may have lived on for much longer, potentially up until 1782. None of these are easy to corroborate, however, as resources detailing the later stages in Anne's life are harder to come by.&nbsp;</p><p>1724 marked the publication of Captain Charles Johnson's seminal volume A General History of the Pyrates, which also touched on Anne's buccaneering years. While the real identity of the author came under contention — with some claiming that it was written by Daniel Defoe under the pseudonym of Captain Charles Johnson — the content of the book has long fascinated readers.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"She was continued in prison, to the time of her lying in, and afterwards reprieved from Time to Time, but what is become of her since, we cannot tell; only this we know, that she was not executed" reportedly states A General History of the Pyrates.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>There once lived a female, named Anne Bonny.
