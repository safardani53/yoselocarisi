Ultimately, he settled in Firebaugh, California.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in 1975, Jason’s grandfather, Buzz, established a 2000-acre cotton farm near Firebaugh, California. After Buzz died in 2013, Joel took over the business.</p><p>So, Joel and his wife, Lavonne (most probably), have been working on the farm since then. Allen got to make a memorable moment on the farm.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the husband and wife built up a work ethic in their children, including Jason, from their early childhood and taught them to be down to earth. For instance, Joel and Lavonne motivated their kids to work on farms.</p><p>As a result, Jason and his other siblings learned the value of ethics.

So, even when we look at Allen in pictures or shows, we can say he has grown up as the humblest man.</p><p>Also, Joel and Lavonne encouraged their children to be engaged in sports.</p><p>So, Jason’s parents always had his back, no matter how challenging the situation was.
