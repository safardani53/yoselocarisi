The couple has been married since 2008. They are parents to two daughters with their&nbsp;third child on the way.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Syd and Shea are open about their family life on the show and have shown much of their daily lives&nbsp;to their audience.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Today&nbsp;the two are incredibly successful because of <a href=# rel=follow>Netflix</a>’s Dream Home Makeover and their brand, Studio McGee. However,&nbsp;they weren’t always doing so well. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In fact, the married couple were broke and in a very tough situation in the past.</p><p>Here’s everything to know about the two.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Met Through Her Brother</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Shea met Syd after moving from her home in Texas to Utah to study at Brigham Young University. Her brother, who was studying at the nearby Utah Valley University, introduced her to his roommate, Syd. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In their book, Make Life Beautiful, which was published in October 2020, Shea <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> her brother didn’t want the two to become a thing and had dissuaded her beforehand. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>My brother said, ‘My buddy Syd will be there and you’re going to like him, but don’t, because he’s my friend.’ As I pulled into the lot, I knew I was in trouble. There Syd was on a skateboard, wearing the skinniest skinny jeans I had ever seen. We went on our first date the next night.</p><p>Shea graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor’s degree in communications in 2007. She tied the knot with Syd a year later, in 2008.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Studio McGee</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Shea and Syd went through a tough phase before they started their hugely popular interior design studio and store, Studio McGee. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Following their marriage, she found her genuine passion lay in designing and started taking night courses in interior designing at a local community college while still working full time in public relations during the day.</p><p>After landing a few styling and decorating gigs, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quit her job</a> in public relations in favor of launching her own business. At the time, she was pregnant with their oldest child, daughter Wren.</p><p>When the Dream Home Makeover stars finally welcomed their daughter, Syd also quit his job at a tech company to focus on Studio McGee, stretching their finances further. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, with a child being put into the equation, Shea revealed&nbsp;things <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got much tougher</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Money problems can be enough to break two people, and throw a new baby into it… it was a hard time. I don’t think that Syd and I ever looked at it like we weren’t going to make it. But we were not happy.</p><p>Syd and his wife&nbsp;welcomed their second child, daughter Ivy, just two years later, making their financial situation even worse.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It was only after years of working 16-17 hours every day&nbsp;that they pulled themselves out of their sticky situation and built their current interior design empire.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Expecting Third Child</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>reality star</a> couple is expecting their third child, which they say will be their “grand finale baby.”</p><p>Having taken care of two newborns while simultaneously managing their business in the past, Shea hopes the 5-year age difference between her 2nd and 3rd child, who is due in mid-July, will make things easier.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKupmXqur8aenGavmZuybr%2FHnphmpZOcsqZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
