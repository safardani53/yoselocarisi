He is the bastard son of Pope Alexander VI and a member of the Hispanic-Aragonese Borgia family. After entering the church and becoming a cardinal in his father's election to the papacy, following the death of his brother in 1498, he became the first person to resign as cardinal. He served as center-back for King Louis XII of France around 1500, and occupied Milan and Naples during wars in Italy. At the same time, he established a state in central Italy, but after the death of his father he was unable to remain in power for a long time. According to Machiavelli, this was not due to lack of anticipation, but his mistake in creating a new pope.</p><table class=wikibox readability=9.5><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>13 September 1475, Subiaco, Papal States (now Italy)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>12 March 1507 (aged 31), Viana, Navarre (now Spain)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Resting place</td><td class=wk_value>Church of Santa Maria, Viana</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Title</td><td class=wk_value>Duke of Valentinois</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Spouse(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Charlotte of Albret</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>Louise Borgia, Duchess of Valentinois, Girolamo Borgia, 10 others</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Parent(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Pope Alexander VI, Vannozza dei Cattanei</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Family</td><td class=wk_value>Borgia</td></tr></table><p>Religious Leader Cesare Borgia was born in Italy on September 13, 1475.
