Young, 35, and DeGarmo, 25, got married on Saturday, June 1 at the Luxe Sunset Boulevard Hotel in Bel Air, Calif., a source confirms to&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Young, an American Idol season five contestant and DeGarmo, a season three runner-up, started dating while performing in 2010's Hair on Broadway. They got engaged during the season 11 American Idol live season finale in May 2012.</p><p>Talking to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> exclusively about their big day on May 23, DeGarmo and Young shared that their 225+ guests, including Idol alums <strong>Elliott Yamin </strong>and <strong>Michael Johns</strong>, will be treated to margarita beers, photo booths and a five-course meal. The couple organized the special day with their wedding planner, Renee Strauss.&nbsp;</p><p>"We want everybody to have fun, let their guard down," Young told Us.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair made sure that their special day will have lots of personal elements to it as well — including their first song, which they co-wrote together eight months ago, appropriately-titled "I Do."</p><p>"We wrote 'I Do,' and the first listen all the way through, we’re both looking at the monitor screen, sobbing," Young recalled to Us. "Right when we’re done, we look at each other and Diana goes, 'I think this one is…' and I said, 'I know.' It was done."</p><p>The pair, who also wrote their own vows for the ceremony, told Us of other little details they did to make their big day memorable — custom-made suits for the groomsmen, white cowboy boots for the bridesmaids, and not one, but two five-tier cakes from The Butter End in Santa Monica, Calif. The flavors? Vanilla and Aunt Edie's Banana Chocolate Chip.</p><p>As for the bride, DeGarmo wore blue cowboy boots and a diamond-white Sareh Nouri designed dress.</p><p>Details and attire aside, DeGarmo and Young gushed to Us about the love they share for each other — and why their love is forever.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"We’re kind of like the yin and yang," DeGarmo reveals.&nbsp;</p><p>Young adds, "We are best friends. And we’re also extremely quirky and that’s a side that a lot of people don’t know unless they know us. We’re big dorks."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaam5VixrDBzaBkppmip7amv4ydoJqmkWKxprPAq6SoZZGhuW7Ax55knZ2klratv4xrZ2prYWt8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
