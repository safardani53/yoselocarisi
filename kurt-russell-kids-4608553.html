Born in Massachusetts and raised in Los Angeles, the 72-year-old star got his start as a child actor on TV shows such as <i>The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, Gunsmoke </i>and <i>Gilligan’s Island. </i>In 1966, he signed a ten-year contract with<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Walt Disney Productions</a> and became one of its biggest draws. In the 80s, he became a bona fide movie star after his two collaborations with director John Carpenter: The Thing and Escape From New York. One of biggest hits was 1987’s Overboard, with his partner <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a>. Later in his career, he would receive accolades for his dramatic turns in Tequila Sunrise, Backdraft and Tombstone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kurt-Russell-Goldie-Hawn-Family-SS-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Not only has he been successful in his professional life, but in his personal life as well. Kurt is the proud papa of son <strong>Boston Russell</strong>, whom he welcomed during his four-year marriage to <strong>Season Hubley</strong>, which ended in 1983. He also shares son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Wyatt Russell</strong></a>&nbsp;with Goldie. As the couple have been in a relationship for over 40 years, Kurt is a fantastic stepfather to Goldie’s other two children, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Oliver Hudson</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a>, as well. Find out all about Kurt’s relationship with the four amazing kids, below.</p><h2><strong><strong>Boston Russell</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kurt-Russell-Goldie-Hawn-Family-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Born on February 16, 1980, Boston is Kurt’s first kid and the only one he shared with his ex Season, whom he met while filming&nbsp;<i>Elvis </i>in 1979. They would divorce in 1983. Season was a veteran TV actress who had roles in The Patridge Family and All My Children. Despite both his parents’ success in Tinseltown, Boston opted to not pursue a career in Hollywood. He has remained out of the spotlight and kept his life relatively private, other than occasionally showing up at red carpets alongside his famous family. In 2017, he did appear at Goldie’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony. Otherwise, there is little known about the eldest of Kurt’s brood.</p><h2><strong><strong>Wyatt Russell</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kurt-Russell-Goldie-Hawn-Family-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Wyatt, on the other hand, is quickly making a name for himself in Tinseltown. After <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attempting a career at hockey</a>, the actor soon found roles on This Is 40,&nbsp;22 Jump Street,&nbsp;Everybody Wants Some!!,&nbsp;Black Mirror,&nbsp;Ingrid Goes West and more. One of his most recent high-profile gigs was on Marvel’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Falcon & The Winter Soldier</a>. Wyatt played <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>John Walker</a>, who is appointed by the U.S. government to be the new Captain America.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In 2022, he was a goalkeeper for the 2022 NHL All-Star Game’s break-away challenge, and in 2023, Wyatt teamed up with his dad, Kurt, to star in the series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. The duo play the same character in different time periods and opened up about the experience to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET </a>in November 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“We were being given this opportunity to play the same person, as opposed to the father and son, so we started hammering away at it and saying, ‘Let’s make this good!'” Kurt told the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“[Playing] father and son is like low-hanging fruit,” Wyatt also shared. “And we’ve never been people, genetically, who have gone for low-hanging fruit. It’s just never been interesting [for me], it’s never been interesting in his career.” He also added that he and Kurt would often ask, “What’s the hardest thing you can do?'” during the production.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kurt also revealed what he learned from the experience. “I suddenly found myself saying, ‘God, well, Wyatt’s gonna create this character, and I’m going to play him later on in life, so its gotta all make sense,” he explained. “And I suddenly realized I’ve watched him all his life, but I’ve never&nbsp;examined&nbsp;him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“That was really interesting, because I started seeing things about him that I could feel resembled me,” he added with a laugh.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>As for Wyatt’s personal life, he was previously married to stylist <strong>Sanne Hamers</strong>. They divorced in 2017. He would go on to marry actress <strong>Meredith Hagner</strong>&nbsp;in 2019. They welcomed their first child, a son named&nbsp;<strong>Buddy</strong>, in March 2021.</p><h2><strong><strong>Kurt’s Relationship With Kate & Oliver</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kurt-Russell-Goldie-Hawn-Family-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>While Kate and Oliver have both spoken out about their estrangement with their biological dad, <strong>Bill Hudson</strong>, the siblings have nothing but love and respect for Kurt for stepping in as a positive role model. Speaking with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Howard Stern</a>&nbsp;</strong>in 2016, Kate gushed about Kurt helping to raise her. “I have a great family, I have a beautiful mother, I have a stepfather who stepped in and played a huge, huge part in sharing what it is to have a dependable father figure in our life,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>She went on to praise Kurt for always taking time for the family, even though he had to balance his Hollywood career. “I think that people can do a lot of things and they can be very successful and they can still be a really good parent because I was raised that way. Kurt is not a perfect man — no one is. But that trust I got from him in terms of his dependability was just priceless for me”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Oliver is always one to give credit to Kurt for raising him as one of his own sons. In a 2015 Instagram post on Father’s Day, Oliver shared an adorable photo of the pair, captioning it, “Happy Father’s Day Pa.” And in an interview this past April, Oliver praised Kurt and Goldie. “My parents are amazing grandparents,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. “We’re a very tight family. We all live very close to each other. … They’re amazing people, amazing grandparents, amazing parents.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8quqa1loqrAtLHLpWSkoZSoenWCj3Fsbmtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
