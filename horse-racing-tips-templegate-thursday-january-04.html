She enjoyed stepping up to this distance and finished really strongly. There was a pretty muddling gallop which didn’t help Bill Turner’s mare who could have done with a lot more pace on. Looking at today’s rivals, there are a couple of front-runners in the field which should make sure there’s more of a lick up front. That will be ideal for this six-year-old who gets on well with 3lb claimer Ben Ffrench Davis and the handicapper has left her mark alone. She looks a good price to go very close again in what looks an open contest.</p><p><strong>LADY IN HAVANA (6.10 Newcastle, nb)</strong></p><p>She has really stepped up her form since going handicapping for trainer David Loughnane. She kicked off with a comfortable success at Southwell before matching that form when second at the Nottinghamshire track 13 days ago. The form of that race has been franked with the winner scoring again since. Both those efforts came over today’s six-furlong trip and she must have a major chance from the same handicap mark as last time.</p><p><strong>LOUISIANA BAY (3.48 Lingfield, treble)</strong></p><p>Was an unlucky loser at Wolverhampton last time. She was forced to come wide around the crucial final bend which proved costly as she was just half a length down at the line. She clocked a fast time tackling that longer trip for the first time and trainer Jack Jones continues in excellent form.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only. £/€10 min stake (if EW then min £/€10 Win + £/€10 Place).
