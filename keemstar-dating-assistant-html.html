He&nbsp;finds himself in a new controversy every day and&nbsp;has admitted he lives for the drama&nbsp;and fuels them whenever he can&nbsp;on his&nbsp;Mom's Basement podcast with Faze Banks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>So, referring to his own words, it can be said that he manipulates his audience to get a reaction out of them. And once again, he has given his fans, followers, and haters another reason to question his mentality.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>On August 4, 2021, Keemstar revealed to his co-host that he was dating a 20-year-old waitress. The pair met at a fan gathering, and she had never heard of the DramaAlert host before.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Keemstar faced&nbsp;massive backlash</a> for the relationship because of the 19-year age gap between him and his girlfriend.&nbsp;The two separated on August 24, 2021 — not even a month after making their relationship public.&nbsp;</p><p>It has only been a few weeks after his breakup, but it seems like Keemstar has moved on. Unfortunately,&nbsp;this time, it is allegedly&nbsp;with his&nbsp;20-year-old assistant.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Is Keemstar Dating His Assistant?&nbsp;</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">age of consent</a> in New York City, where Keemstar resides, is 17. So if a person&nbsp;is 18, then they have&nbsp;the right to be with whoever they want. Regardless, the massive age gap is still disgusted upon by the public.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On September 4, 2021, the DramaAlert host uploaded a video of himself listening to Drake's new song on his Twitter. While moving around and smoking in his house, he shows a young girl doing jumping splits on the bed.&nbsp;</p><p>The video caused many people to question who the girl was and why she was in Keemstar's house. The news started spreading across various social media platforms, including Reddit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Keemstar denied dating his assistant but continued to troll his followers on Twitter. He asked people to stop telling him to date people his age, since it would make no one mad if he did so.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He then posted a picture of an old lady and called her Betty. He mocked his followers by saying that Betty was his new girlfriend.</p><p>Keemstar said he would date Betty's granddaughter if&nbsp;he does not get the same anger for dating an older woman as he got for dating a 20-year-old. He even tagged <a href=# rel=follow>Trisha Paytas</a> in the tweet since they called him out for dating young girls.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He continued to make fun of his followers by posting a video of himself on a stream, smugly smiling at the camera and stroking his beard. He said that he was a 40-year-old who looked better and got better girls than everybody through the captions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Keemstar went to the stream with his assistant since she also uploaded a picture of both of them in the exact location. To date, she has posted two photos with the DramaAlert host and has called him "the best boss."&nbsp;</p><p>She has also denied dating Keemstar.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Is Keemstar’s Assistant?</h2><p>There is not much information available about Keemstar's assistant, and all information about her is from her Instagram, @brantleys_insta. Her name is Alyssa Haleigh Brantley,&nbsp;and she is 20-year-old according to her Instagram bio.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She graduated from&nbsp;Belton-Honea Path High School, South Carolina, in 2020.&nbsp;She was&nbsp;planning to go to Kenneth Shuler Cosmetology School after high school, but it is not clear if she went or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, she is living in New York and&nbsp;working for Keemstar. However, it is not known when she started working for him.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOVmrq0wMCrZJ2ZpJ67qHnArKqiq6SWu7V6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
