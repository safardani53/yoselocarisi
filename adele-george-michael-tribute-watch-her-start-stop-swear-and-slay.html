I’m sorry for swearing. I’m sorry for starting again. Can we please start it again?"</p><p>"I’m sorry … I cant mess this up for him. I’m sorry."</p><p>"I’m sorry for swearing! I’m really sorry. Sorry.”</p><p>It was worth it. Adele went on to turn in a beautiful, stunning tribute, in which scenes from Michael’s iconic career played on screen.&nbsp;</p><p>You can watch it in its entirety below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>She received a standing ovation – perhaps even bigger than the one that followed the show-opening <a href=#>Adele "Hello" Grammy performance</a>.</p><p>It was an unorthodox, but moving take on the track.</p><p>“Adele chose to sing ‘Fastlove, pt. 1’ herself,” reveals an Adele source. “That was her pick. She really wanted to perform that song.”&nbsp;</p><p>The song is normally mid-to-up-tempo, but given his recent passing at the age of 53, Adele’s slower, orchestral version was perfect.</p><p>Michael would have likely been touched by it.</p><p>"He would smile and be so proud that this artist is performing this song," James Corden, the host of the event, said of Adele’s performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-682x1024.jpg><p>Just as <a href=#>Bruno Mars honored Prince</a> at the Grammy Awards, Michael received a fitting send-off after his life ended far too soon last year.</p><p>Michael sold over 100 million records during his career, first as a teen idol and later as an introspective, boundary-pushing solo artist.</p><p>The openly gay, two-time Grammy winner was an innovator in the studio and on stage, and a dedicated philanthropist in his personal life.</p><p>It’s no surprise that his legacy has touched so many brilliant performers across generations and around the world, this one among them.</p><p>As for Adele, <a href=#>she won Album of the Year</a> last night, though if you take her word for it, it was Beyonce who truly deserved to win the honor.</p><p>“I’m very humbled and I’m very grateful and gracious, but my artist of my life is Beyoncé," the 28-year-old singer told the audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/adele-is-so-happy-925x1024.jpg><p>Clearly wanting to stay on the&nbsp;Beyhive’s&nbsp;good side, she added:</p><p>"This album to me, the Lemonade album, was just so monumental. It was so monumental and thought-out and so beautiful and soul-baring."</p><p>"We all got to see another side to you that you don’t always let us see and we appreciate that," Adele told a beaming Beyonce Sunday.</p><p>"All us artists here adore you. You are our light!”</p><p>Fans also apparently learned, over the course of that same speech, that the notoriously private <a href=#>Adele is married to Simon Konecki</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Quite a night!
