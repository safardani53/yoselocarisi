According to the TikToker, his son hit his mom and had to face the consequences. Although his first instinct was to spank his son, he tried the water jug method instead.</p><p>“We're not allowed to spank in the state of Wisconsin because there [are] some [liberals] saying there [are] better ways,” he said in the clip, which has more than a million views as of this writing.</p><p>“I know just an a-- whoopin' is what it needs but like I said, I can't do it no more. [If] you spank your kid, you will go to jail,” he went on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>As the 4-year-old struggled to make it back and forth across the yard more than a dozen times, his dad showed him a little tough love: “I love you, son. But we do not hit women in this family, sorry.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Throughout the video, Derek shared more <a href=#>heartwarming affirmations</a> with his son until he got to the finish line. That said, Derek added: “I couldn't even imagine what it'd be like if I got away with hitting my mom,” Derek said. “I can just feel the a-- whooping I would have got thinking about it.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He asked for TikTok users to leave “constructive criticism” in the comments — preferably not from Negative Nancys. “If you have negative comments you’re probably the reason I can't spank my child,” Derek went on.</p><p>After his son was done with his punishment, Derek congratulated the 4-year-old and reminded him that he had to do it for his own good.</p><p>“You carried seven gallons of water 51 feet — 102 feet total,” he gushed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“I don't even know if that's accurate math here, guys. It’s just a rough estimate, I'm probably way off. But look at that," Derek went on.</p><p>Since the video made its rounds on social media, many have taken to the comments to commend the dad on his method of parenting.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I think it’s quite an age-appropriate consequence for his actions,” a commenter named @squarebobspongepantss wrote. “Also, the encouragement is what I think would actually make it register with him in a positive way as opposed to fear-based.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Another person, @plinderhhp, shared: “I [raised] three boys, and sir you were doing absolutely the right thing you’re teaching him so much more than just not to hit his mama. Keep up the good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6lecyaop6rXai8r3nCmqmrsV2srrWx0Wahrp%2Bj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
