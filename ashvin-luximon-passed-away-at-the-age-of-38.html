On August 11, he was laid to rest. Following the actor‚Äôs passing, Luximon‚Äôs family established a memorial website to raise donations for various organizations.

He portrayed Martin Fowler‚Äôs high school classmate. In the play, both Fowler and Malik were involved in a variety of issues, including stealing and vandalism.&nbsp;Luximon‚Äôs character was largely linked to the plots of Martin and his classmates, Nicky Di Marco and Janine Butcher. In the episode, Malik developed a fancy for Janine, but it was never returned; he also went on a couple of dates with Nicky, which did not work out.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ashvin-Luximon.jpg alt="Ashvin Luximon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Luximon, who was born in Enfield, appears in 146 EastEnders episodes.&nbsp;Malik last appeared on the program in October 2003, after the completion of his A-levels and enrollment in the university. After that, he was no longer on the program, and it was revealed the following year that he was a resident of Edinburgh and was getting married when he asked Martin to a stag party off-screen.&nbsp;EastEnders, created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland, originally aired in 1985. The narrative of the series, which dealt with subjects such as violence, r*pe, murder, and abuse, was both lauded and ridiculed.</p><h2>Twitter users pay tribute</h2><p>Despite having just two acting credits to his name, Ashvin Luximon was well-known among the crowd for his faultless performances.
