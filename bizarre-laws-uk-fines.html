class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>BIZARRE laws you don't know you're breaking could leave you with a £500 fine.</p><p>From having fun in the snow to jumping queues, these seven seemingly innocent activities are all punishable offences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Online breaks down Britain's most bonkers statutes.</p><h2>SKIDDING ON ICE</h2><p>You are not allowed to slide on snow or ice in London.</p><p>The rule applies to frozen surfaces in "any roadway or other thoroughfare", according to the Metropolitan Police Act of 1989.</p><p>If you dare partake in the prohibited activity, you're not just posing a "common hazard" to other Londoners.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on bizarre laws">Read More on bizarre laws</h2><p>Incredibly, you could also land yourself with a fine of up to £500, so it's probably best to not take yourself for a slide,</p><h2>FLYING KITES IN PUBLIC</h2><p>The popular pastime is in fact illegal in public spaces under section 54 of the Metropolitan Police Act 1839.</p><p>The activity, seemingly innocent, was clamped down on to prevent danger to others.</p><p>It was also deemed a "nuisance" at the time and is technically illegal, but rarely enforced.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><h2>CARRYING WOOD</h2><p>Hauling planks of wood down a street is another activity that is technically illegal.</p><p>Just like flying kites, carrying timber on the pavement, unless being loaded or unloaded from a vehicle, is banned.</p><p>The law under the same Met Cops' act from 1839 dates back to the Middle Ages when carts were regularly overloaded and folk were at risk of falling wood.</p><h2>DING DONG DITCH</h2><p>Also known as ringing doorbells and running away, the irritating prank often played by youngsters is also illegal.</p><p>Section 54 of the Metropolitan Police Act 1839 applies to anyone "wilfully and wantonly" disturbing any inhabitant by ringing doorbells or knocking "without lawful excuse".</p><h2>SHAKING OUT CARPETS</h2><p>Section 60 of the same 1839 act says public bashing of dusty carpets in London is banned.</p><p>It was brought in to stop Brits causing a mess in the streets and being a general nuisance to other citizens.</p><p>Despite the ban, you are allowed to shake your doormat, but only before 8am, according to the rules.</p><p>Shaking down carpets in the streets will not lead to a fine and it's unlikely to be enforced.</p><h2>NIGHT TIME BOOZE</h2><p>In 2005 Scots were told they would only be able to buy alcohol between 10am and 10pm seven days a week.</p><p>The rules, contained in the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, are different to England where you can legally snap up booze 24/7.</p><p>Bars, pubs, clubs and hotels are not subject to the booze curfew.</p><p>Scots were once unable to buy booze until 12.30pm on Sundays, but this is no longer the case.</p><h2>QUEUE JUMPING</h2><p>You cannot jump a queue at London's tube station ticket halls, according to Transport for London bylaws.</p><p>If you do, you must join the back of the line and the rule is in place for safety reasons, their website states.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Despite the rules, TfL have never actually prosecuted anyone for skipping the queue, according to a Freedom of Information request dating back to 2020.</p><p>But the organisation warns: "If a customer refused to comply and was causing a safety issue, or their behaviour escalated, the BTP (British Transport Police) would be called."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
