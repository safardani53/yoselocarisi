Sometimes I’d turn up to a club and it would be empty. At times I thought I’d have to give it up and get a nine-to-five job.”</p><p>Joel tried to move on from clips of him arguing on MTV with his Geordie Shore ex Sophie Kasaei, adding: “There is a stigma around reality TV, but it just motivated me more.</p><p>“When it finally happened for me it felt better as I went through those years of trying.”</p><p>Joel has treated his mum Debbie since his single shot to No1 in the charts last year.</p><p>He said: “I’m always treating her. I recently replaced her fancy kettle. I went on Amazon and spent over £100 on it — she was buzzing. Mum loves a cup of tea.”</p><p>Slick Joel is looking forward to getting dressed up for the slimmed-down event on May 11 at London’s O2 Arena.</p><p>He said: “I’m coming suited and booted to the Brits, I don’t really wear suits so I’m going to be James Bond-slick.
