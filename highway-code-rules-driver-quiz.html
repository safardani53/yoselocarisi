They should stop and wait for a safe gap as they would for other vehicles.</p><p><strong>4) ANSWER IS A - Ride in the centre of their lane on quiet or slow-moving roads and keep 1.5ft away from the kerb edge on busy, fast-moving roads.</strong></p><p>The advice is also to keep at least a door width away from parked cars. Two people may cycle abreast in the road - it can be safer to do so, especially if in a large group or accompanying less experienced riders.</p><p><strong>5) ANSWER IS D - All of the above</strong></p><p>When passing a horse-rider on a shared stretch, they must not pass too closely or too fast, and should avoid passing on the horse’s left also.</p><p><strong>6) ANSWER IS B - Opening the car door with the hand further away from the door</strong></p><p>The Dutch Reach is a safer way to open the car door because it makes the driver turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them and they are less likely to cause injury to those passing.</p><p><strong>7 ANSWER IS C - Park close to the charge point, using a warning sign if you can, return cables and connectors neatly to avoid danger to others</strong></p><p>Parking close to the charge point avoids creating a trip hazard for others and returning cables neatly minimises danger and does not create any obstacles for other road users.</p><p><strong>8) ANSWER IS C - Cyclists should not move across the path of drivers when travelling on a roundabout</strong></p><p>Cyclists have priority on roundabouts, should be able to travel in the left hand lane and be free to travel across the path of drivers if necessary.</p><p><strong>9) ANSWER IS A - Leave at least 1.5m when overtaking at speeds of up to 30mph</strong></p><p>When passing people riding horses, vehicles should leave at least 2m and drive at under 10mph; when passing people walking in the road, they should allow at least 2m and keep to a low speed.</p><p><strong>10) ANSWER IS A - Vehicle</strong></p><p>Cyclists should proceed as if they are a vehicle if there are no separate cycling facilities, including positioning themselves in the centre of the chosen lane, where they are able to safely, and giving way to pedestrians. However, cyclists do have priority over traffic when going straight ahead at junctions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoZ4fY9xbG9nmJ60qcPAsmScp5SaerPBy56qZpyinsOmvoyqrKKyXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
