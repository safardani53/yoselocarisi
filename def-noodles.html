It comes down to a lack of insight and accountability.</p><p>It’s not actually surprising that Feitosa has changed up his content since his rise in late 2019. Feitosa’s content has consistently shifted over the past decade, so seeing this new string of moves isn’t entirely out of the ordinary.</p><p>But the move strained the already-fraught trust he had from fans, which had already been complicated by half-truths he’d shared throughout his career, like about his age.</p><p>Some say he is really 37 years old and false allegations against Charles. Most notably, when James Charles was accused of sexting minors in February 2021, Feitosa was the one who collected and tweeted the multiple allegations before news outlets even noticed.</p><p>As people question what the creator is doing at present, it’s worth looking at how the creator has acted in the past to give onlookers a better understanding of who Def Noodles actually is.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_was_Def_Noodles_canceled></span>Why was Def Noodles canceled?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Def Noodles Was Banned From Twitch After Using Poppers on a Stream.

It was inspired from satirical TV shows like “The Soup”.</p><p>The since-banned Twitter account had over 150,000 followers prior to being banned. It would often break major news about celebrities and influencers, including James Charles and David Dobrik.</p><p>In Monday’s video, entitled “The End of Def Noodles,” Feitosa had a “conversation” with Def Noodles to explain why he was leaving him behind.</p><p>Addressing the Def Noodles character, Feitosa said, “There are plenty of problems [with you]. First off, you got banned on Twitter, you have major credibility issues. Some people just don’t seem to get the joke and honestly, you’re a bit that overstayed it’s welcome.”</p><p>Feitosa said Def Noodles had been “restricting [him] creatively” and he wanted to “introduce new ideas into the channel.”</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who is Stephen Harlowe?</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Def_Noodles_Ethnicity></span>Def Noodles Ethnicity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Def Noodles was born in Morristown, New Jersey to <strong>Brazilian parents and was raised in São Paulo, Brazil</strong>.</p><p>He is of <strong>Italian-Portuguese descent</strong>.
