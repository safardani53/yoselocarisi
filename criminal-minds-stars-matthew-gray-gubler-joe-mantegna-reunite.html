I was welcomed by the cast and crew instantly, making me feel part of the team on day one. The next 12 years would be a wild and wonderful ride. Yes, I will miss playing David Rossi, and I’ll miss the wonderful writing that brought him to life, but mostly I will miss seeing my fellow cast mates and our fantastic crew every day. It may seem like a cliché to say we’re like family, but it’s so very true.”</p><p>He continued: “In 15 seasons, we’ve all grown a little older, hopefully a little wiser too. We laughed together, we cried together, and like a family we gained and lost members along the way. Some got married, some got divorced, some had children, some had more than one! … As I pack up my belongings from my trailer and load my car, I am satisfied with what we accomplished and proud of the work.”</p><p>Nearly a year later, Criminal Minds — which began airing on CBS in 2005 — wrapped up its final season in February 2020 and Gubler took to social media to reflect on the last 15 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Matthew-Gray-Gubler-Reunites-With-Former-Criminal-Minds-Costar-Joe-Mantegna-01.jpg><p>“I’ve carried these 3 props with me almost every day for the last 15 years,” he captioned a <a href=#>Twitter photo</a> of his FBI badge, pistol and watch. “After tonight I’ll just carry them in my heart where I will forever keep memories of the best crew, the best cast, and the best fands (fans/friends) a fictional crimefighter could ever have.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In July 2022, it was announced that the franchise would be back via a 10-episode series titled <a href=#>Criminal Minds: Evolution</a>.
