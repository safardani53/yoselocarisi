You admit you’ve had work done, which I think is to your credit. But you look amazing,” Kelly said to the actress, 79, who appeared alongside her <i>Our Souls at Night</i> costar <b>Robert Redford</b>. “I read that you said you’re not proud to admit you’ve had work done. Why not?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jane-fonda-megyn-kelly-ed174015-cb91-4538-a38f-3cf9722024ae.jpg><p>Fonda looked agitated at the question as she retorted: “We <i>really</i> want to talk about that now?” to which Kelly replied, “Well, one of the things people think when they look at you is how amazing you look.”</p><p>Fonda expertly shut down the former Fox News host by pulling the conversation back to her film. “Well, thanks,” she said. “Good attitude, good <a href=# data-link=1>posture</a>, take care of myself. But let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, <i>Our Souls at Night</i>, rather than plastic surgery.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jane-fonda-megyn-kelly-02-52cb9357-f49c-412c-aa49-67778e032d5c.jpg><p>The actress<a href=# rel=noopener> opened up in 2012</a> about going under the knife. “I’ve had plastic surgery,” she told Access Hollywood at the time. “I made sure that they kept my lines. I didn’t want to lose my wrinkles — I just wanted to lose the bags under my eyes.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“But if I’m really honest,” she continued, “I think the most important thing comes from the inside and in that sense, exercise and yoga, in particular, helps with that. If you feel good about yourself, if you feel good in your skin, in addition to having friends and love around you, it comes through your eyes and your face and your smile and I think people – they don’t realize that’s what they’re picking up on. It’s an attitude that matters more than anything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ6aeqe7zZ2YZquYqsG0ecOorqdlnZq0urqMpJylpKmoerG4wKyroptdqMKzs8SrsGappZrAtbXOp2SwbWBqhHOAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
