Some viewers have speculated that August <a href=#>is gay</a>, and after a little digging, we were able to find evidence of his past relationships.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">August Kilcher isn't gay — but he does appear to be single at the moment.</h2><p>The reality star’s mom previously shared photos of his last two girlfriends on Instagram, which made fans very happy. Shortly after August’s high school graduation in 2016, Charlotte <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a picture</a> of the then teen with a girl named Megan, leading followers to leave comments like, "What a nice looking couple" and "So glad you have found someone to love."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>By 2017, August was dating a woman named Geneva, and — according to Charlotte's social media activity — they stayed together for at least a year. The pair allegedly split before February 2019, which is when one fan remarked, "I hope August finds a great girl."</p><p>In a 2020 special celebrating The Last Frontier's upcoming 10th season, the TV personality didn’t address his current relationship status, but did reveal that a stranger had recently come to his house to ask if they could quarantine together. Talk about creepy.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Alaska is very much a red state, August seems to have adopted a more liberal mindset when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. On May 4, he urged <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram followers</a> to take COVID-19 seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s been a minute since I’ve posted anything, but wanted to let people know that a: I’m still alive and 2: that we can get through these unprecedented, trying, uncertain, desperate (insert buzzwords here) times," he wrote, adding, "Regardless of what media tells you, be smart and safe."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He concluded his message by stating, "This is our lives, our families’ lives, and our neighbors’ lives that we have in our (washed) hands alone. Also masks aren’t hurting anyone."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Otto got emotional when talking about the kind of man August is today.</h2><p>During the family’s Discovery Channel special, which aired a week before The Last Frontier's Season 10 premiere, Otto reflected on the growth he’s seen in his son. "I’ve been watching August come into his own for a long time. He’s just — he’s the best," the proud father gushed.&nbsp;</p><p>"When I’m around people like [him], I just want to live to be 200 years old," the 68-year-old continued. "I’ll never be able to teach him everything he needs but I feel like I’ve done a really good job on teaching him how to figure it out… Were I to tip over today, he’d very easily carry on and that’s a real big sense of pride for me."</p><p>New episodes of Alaska: The Last Frontier air Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on Discovery Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurdSgrKysXaC2ra%2FHnqlmn5Gu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
