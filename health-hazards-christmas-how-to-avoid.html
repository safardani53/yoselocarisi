burns</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>IT'S the most wonderful time of year but watch out…it can leave you feeling ill.</p><p>Vanessa Chalmers reveals how to avoid trouble and what you can do if it strikes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hilarious-funny-santa-claus-sitting-866062109.jpg><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Food poisoning</h2><p>NO one wants to spend their Christmas holidays on the toilet thanks to a bout of food poisoning.</p><p>Dr Tom Jenkins, an NHS GP, says food tends to be kept in stacked fridges for longer at this time of year, and warns this can be a breeding ground for bacteria.</p><p>He adds: “Don’t leave open or cooked food standing at room temperature for more than two hours, or one hour in the case of rice-based dishes.</p><p>“Wash hands before handling food, and especially after handling pets, going to the toilet or touching the bin.</p><p>“Regularly wash down all food preparation areas, especially after preparing raw food.</p><p>“If you’re feeling at all unwell, delegate the cooking to someone else.”</p><p>If food poisoning strikes, stay hydrated – but not with alcohol or coffee – and eat small and bland meals.</p><p>It’s time to seek medical help when your symptoms persist for more than three days, or if you experience blood in your stool, severe abdominal pain, or prolonged vomiting.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Being unwell can also make your blood sugar drop or rise, so people with diabetes should take extra care, and contact their diabetes care team if they are unsure about what to do.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Burns</h2><p>THERE is lots of opportunity for burns during the festivities, especially in the kitchen but also at other places around the home.</p><p>Dr Tom Jenkins says: “Remembering simple precautions can make a big difference, not only to your safety but to children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000867127806.jpg><p>“In the kitchen, turn pot handles inwards and don’t leave food unattended on the stove.</p><p>“In the bathroom, you can use the thermometer to make sure the bath or shower water is under 44C, and consider radiator covers to avoid contact burns.</p><p>“Do not apply a hot water bottle or electric blanket to the skin or use them together.”</p><p>If a burn does occur, refer to the NHS website.</p><p>Remove clothing or jewellery near the burn, but never anything that has stuck to the skin.</p><p>Dr Jenkins says: “Cool the burn under lukewarm water for 20 to 30 minutes.</p><p>“Do not use ice, iced water or any cream or lotion.</p><p>“Cover the burn in clingfilm, to prevent infection and soothe pain.</p><p>“Seek help if there is swelling, blistering, white discolouration, any electrical burn, or any affecting face, neck, hands, feet or genitals.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Gout</h2><p>A TYPE of <a href=#>arthritis</a>, gout is caused by having too much uric acid in the bloodstream.</p><p>Diet plays an important role in the painful condition, so attacks become more common during party season.</p><p>Dr Taher Mahmud, of the <a href=# aria-label="London Osteoporosis Clinic (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">London Osteoporosis Clinic</a>, says: “Alcohol, in all forms, is thought to increase uric acid production, so moderation is critical in preventing <a href=#>gout</a> attacks.</p><p>“Having a large glass of water after each drink may help you moderate the amount and track precisely what you are drinking.”</p><p>Avoid foods high in purine, which also increases uric acid crystals.</p><p>These include seafood, oily fish such as mackerel, game, offal and yeast extracts like Marmite.</p><p>Dr Mahmud adds: “An increased level of vitamin C [found in Brussels sprouts, potatoes, broccoli, blackcurrants and citrus fruits] may help to reduce risk of a gout attack.</p><p>“Cherries have been linked to decreased levels of uric acid.</p><p>“Getting enough exercise can also help.”</p><p>Stock up on ibuprofen, as anti-inflammatories are the first call of treatment – and if necessary, ice the affected area.</p><p>Seek medical help if you feel nauseous, can’t eat, have a high temperature or your gout is worsening.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Headaches</h2><p>CHRISTMAS can make you feel like wanting to lie down in a dark room, at the best of times.</p><p>Those who suffer <a href=#>headaches or migraines</a> may not have a choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/girl-dressed-christmas-drinking-tea-866053238.jpg><p>Dr Baldeep Farmah, founder of teeth-grinding management service <a href=# aria-label="the Bruxism Clinic, (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">T</a><a aria-label="the Bruxism Clinic, (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he Bruxism Clinic, </a>says: “Headaches at Christmas can be triggered by various factors including <a href=#>stress</a>, lack of sleep, hangovers and exposure to strong seasonal scents.”</p><p>He recommends getting enough fresh air, exercise and water, particularly if you’re drinking booze, and adds: “Sugar spikes can also cause headaches so keep sugar intake to a minimum.”</p><p>Get clued up on which Christmas foods can aggravate stress – including aged cheeses, smoked fish, red wine and cured meats.</p><p>If a headache strikes, try a cold or hot flannel on the head and rest in a quiet room.</p><p>Paracetamol can ease headaches caused by tension, stress or a common cold.</p><p>Cut back on caffeine and stay hydrated.</p><p>Dr Farmah adds: “Bruxism, or the clenching or grinding of teeth, can lead to headaches due to stress or <a href=#>anxiety</a>.</p><p>“A dentist may recommend a mouth guard to wear while sleeping.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Heartburn</h2><p>UNCOMFORTABLE and persistent <a href=#>heartburn</a> is caused by stomach acid travelling up to the throat.</p><p>Rob Hobson, who is a registered nutritionist at <a href=# aria-label="Healthspan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Healthspan</a>, a supplier of vitamins, minerals and health supplements, advises laying off the drink and after-dinner coffees.</p><p>He says: “Alcohol produces more stomach acid and makes the oesophagus more sensitive to it, while caffeine relaxes the lower end of the oesophagus allowing more stomach acid to move upwards.”</p><p>It is also wise to take a break from citrus fruits and juices, and Rob adds: “Processed snacks like crisps, fried foods, and fatty meats such as sausages and bacon can aggravate acid reflux.”</p><p>Eating slowly, smaller portions and chewing your food properly can help, too.</p><p>If you want to get stock in to combat potential cases of heartburn this Christmas, Rob recommends Healthspan<a href=# aria-label=" GastriSoothe sachets (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> GastriSoothe sachets</a> – 24 for £14.95.</p><p>Or try the advice from Dr Richard Middleton, pharmacist and director of the British Herbal Medicine Association, who recommends milk thistle.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">The blues</h2><p>THE festive season can be a particularly difficult time for those experiencing grief or who have fractured family relationships.</p><p>Psychologist Dr Joanna Silver says: “Plan carefully to ensure you have time to look after yourself and attend to your own needs.</p><p>“It is important to be honest about how you are feeling and remember that not everyone is happy at Christmas time and your feelings are valid and not wrong.</p><p>“If you do experience a low mood, it may be helpful to you to talk to someone you trust about your feelings and to do things that help your mood.</p><p>“This may include going for a walk, listening to music and having a soothing bath.”</p><p>Nutritionist Phil Beard, at <a href=# aria-label="Viridian Nutrition, (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viridian Nutrition,</a> recommends its Magnesium B6 and Saffron capsules, 60 for £27.15.</p><p>He says: “The combination may be a great solution for feeling more uplifted during winter, by giving you energy.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Anxiety</h2><p>FOR many, this time of year can worsen anxiety issues.</p><p>Dr Rina Bajaj, <a href=# aria-label="counselling psychologist and author of The Magic In Me, (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">counselling psychologist and author of The Magic In Me,</a> says: “There is often a pressure to attend gatherings, engage in conversations, and also meet with your extended family.</p><p>“People may fear judgment or struggle with feelings of self-consciousness.”</p><p>She adds: “There can also be an unrealistic pressure to create the ‘perfect’ Christmas.</p><p>“If you have a lot to do, break tasks into smaller, manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed.”</p><p>Dr Bajaj says to limit anxiety, manage expectations of what the big day should look like, and focus on what’s really important.</p><p>If things do start to get too much for you, she says deep-breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques can help reduce anxiety in the moment.</p><p>“Focusing on your breath can be calming,” she explains.</p><p>“You can also make changes such as limiting alcohol and caffeine, as excessive intake can exacerbate anxiety.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Choking</h2><p>IF someone over the age of one is <a href=#>choking</a>, the British Red Cross recommends bending them forward and giving five blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.</p><p>Next, try abdominal thrusts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2k91946-man-coughs-christmas-home-867126504.jpg><p>Place your arms around their waist and bend them forward.</p><p>Clench one fist and place it right above their belly button.</p><p>Put the other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inward and upward.</p><p>Repeat this up to five times.</p><p>If a baby is choking, deliver five back blows while holding the baby along your thigh, their head lower than their bottom.</p><p>Next, turn the baby over so they are facing upwards and give up to five chest thrusts with two fingers placed in the middle of the chest.</p><p>Push down sharply.</p><p>Support the baby’s head with both movements.</p><p>If both back blows and chest thrusts fail, call 999 and repeat the steps.</p><p>GP Dr Tom Jenkins says: “For children under four, cut food into pieces no larger than half an inch and, with lots of toys lying around, be careful to keep small objects such as beads, coins, batteries or Lego pieces out of reach.”</p><p>Nutritionist Rob Hobson says: “Some Christmas foods, like fish (with bones), nuts, hard sweets, olives, dried fruits, and large and tough bits of meat may pose a choking risk.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Debt worries</h2><p>SPENDING can get out of control so easily over the festive season, leading to anxiety.</p><p>Dr Mahrukh Khwaja, <a href=# aria-label="aka the Mind Ninja (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">aka the Mind Ninja</a>, is a psychologist and accredited mindfulness teacher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/young-worried-woman-manage-bills-867126782.jpg><p>She advises: “Write down your fears and anxious thoughts. You can start by recognising unhelpful thought patterns, like catastrophising, when something happens and we go to the worst-case scenario in seconds.</p><p>“Writing can also help us reframe our thoughts into more helpful ones, such as, ‘I will figure this out. No problem is unresolvable’.”</p><p>But for some, financial problems are a serious worry.</p><p>Dr Khwaja says: “Face this by proactively writing a list of things you can control and can’t control around money.</p><p>“You could create a budget and track your progress with a spreadsheet, helping you reduce unnecessary costs.”</p><p>The NHS directs those worried about debt and other financial concerns to <a aria-label="Citizens Advice (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Citizens Advice</a>, the<a aria-label=" National Debtline (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> National Debtline</a> or <a href=# aria-label="MoneyHelper (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MoneyHelper</a>.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Heart attack</h2><p>MORE people die from heart attacks in the last week of December than at any other time of the year, says the American Heart Association.</p><p>Dr Tom Jenkins says: “The risk increases due to factors such as stress, overheating, alcohol consumption, cold weather and lack of physical activity.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mid-adult-african-american-man-867135655.jpg><p>But it doesn’t feel right to cut back on all life’s luxuries during party season, and Dr Jenkins says you can still enjoy it if you don’t binge and keep portions sensible.</p><p>To offset the harms, he advises: “Remember to include fruit, and think about healthy snacks such as nuts and dried fruit in place of chocolate, cake and biscuits.</p><p>“Try to stay active, and aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity over the week.</p><p>“A brisk walk will lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar, as well as improve your mood, energy and sleep.</p><p>“If quitting smoking has been on your list as a resolution for the New Year, why not start early to reduce your risk of heart attack now?</p><p>“There are many resources and support services to help you quit smoking and you can always approach your practice nurse for support.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Eating disorders</h2><p>FOR people with anorexia, binge-eating disorder, bulimia or any other disordered eating patterns, this can be an extremely difficult time.</p><p>Jason Ward, UKCP-accredited psychotherapist and clinic director of <a href=# aria-label="DBT London Services, (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">DBT London Services,</a> advises planning meals in advance to avoid “decision fatigue”.</p><p>He adds: “Encourage a focus on the season’s social and emotional aspects, rather than the food.</p><p>“Activities like walking, games, or charity work can provide a sense of purpose and fulfilment that sidesteps the centrality of food.”</p><p>Dr Silver, psychologist at <a href=# aria-label="Orri (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orri</a> eating disorder treatment clinics, agrees and says: “The emphasis on eating and drinking can increase feelings of uncertainty, fear and guilt for people who have difficult relationships with food.”</p><p>Christmas can see relatives talking about food and weight more than usual.</p><p>Dr Silver says: “I would suggest not engaging with these conversations and thinking carefully in advance about strategies that can get through difficult times, such as talking to a trusted friend about feelings.”</p><p>For more support, visit the Beat Eating Disorders website.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Medications</h2><p>WITH less than a week to go until the Big Day, hopefully you have planned ahead to make sure you have enough prescription meds.</p><p>Pharmacist Dr Richard Middleton says: “Tactfully ensure elderly relatives who may be staying with you are also planning ahead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/home-first-aid-kit-blue-867127801.jpg><p>“Check with your GP’s website on how to seek urgent care over the festive period. Most areas have minor injury units or urgent care centres that are available and very effective.”</p><p>Dr Middleton recommends stocking up the first-aid kit with plasters, antiseptic liquid, paracetamol and anti-inflammatory ibuprofen.</p><p>To ward off any colds and flus that relatives bring to the house, he recommends <a href=# aria-label="Centoreze (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centoreze</a>, which contains pelargonium extract – the first and only herbal medicine recommended as part of Nice guidelines.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He adds: “For maximum benefit, it is important to start taking it as soon as symptoms appear.</p><p>“So have some in your medicine cabinet ready for action.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ5hZFybnFnmJqurcDHZp%2BaspGnsbR5wqGpoqukoq60eceormasn2Kut7vInWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
