The singer-turned actor was seen with his usual curly dark locks straightened, parted to the side, and slicked back while wearing a white T-shirt that had the words “Don’t Trip” in multi colors on the left upper side and matching tie-dye colored sweat pants. He was also holding a white face mask up to his mouth and donning red, white, and blue sneakers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/harry-styles-hair-makeover-splashnews-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Once pics of Harry’s different hairstyle made their way online, fans couldn’t resist commenting on them and many seemed to love the new look. “most important thing in life right now?

The cut gave the British hunk a far less <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>curly-haired</a> look and left him with locks that were reminiscent of the hairstyle he had in the 2017 film Dunkirk. Although the photo made waves, it seems that he first got the haircut some time before that, since fan photos <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in Sept.</a> also showed him with a look that was much shorter than the long curly mane he had been wearing the past few years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Harry’s short hair is most likely for the character he will play in Don’t Worry, Darling, a psychological thriller directed by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></a> that he will star in with her and <strong>Florence Pugh</strong>. It was reported that the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>One Direction</strong></a> member would replace <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Shia LaBeouf</a> </strong>in the flick in early Sept.
