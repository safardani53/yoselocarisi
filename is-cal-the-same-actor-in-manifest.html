But don't worry, the show isn't over just yet. The last season has actually been divided into two parts, which means <a href=#>new episodes are still to come</a>.</p><p>But bringing it back to the most recent episode drop, some fans have pointed out that the show's character <a href=#>Cal Stone</a> seems a little different. As a refresher, he did age five years at the end of Season 3, which could alter his appearance and personality.</p><p>But is this older Cal the same actor we’ve been watching since the show's inception?
