The biggest hit song of his career, "Walking the Floor Over You," marks the rise of tonky music. In 1948, he was the first singer to successfully record the "Blue Christmas" version of Billy Hayes and Jay W. Johnson, a song often associated with Elvis Presley and his version from the late 1950s. Another popular Tubb hit was "Waltz Across Texas" which became one of his most requested songs and is often used in Texas nightclubs during waltz lessons. Tubb recorded duets with emerging Loretta Lynn in the early 1960s, including their hit "Sweet Thang".
