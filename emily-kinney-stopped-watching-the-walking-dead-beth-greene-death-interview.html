Hm, probably not. So, you can’t blame Emily for cutting The Walking Dead out of her life once she was done filming.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I stopped watching,” Emily told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY at the 2015 Shorty Awards on April 20 in New York City. “I didn’t see my death, because I had my own experience, and I didn’t want to change what my experience of it was because it was so special to me.”</p><h3>Emily Kinney: ‘The Walking Dead’ Star Finds New Life On ‘The Flash’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>But, she couldn’t completely escape her connection to the show so easily. In fact, Emily revealed that even though she didn’t watch her mid-season finale death or the return episodes, she did watch the season five finale.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I found out <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Melissa [McBride]</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Norman [Reedus]</strong></a> were going to be on ‘The Talking Dead,’ and I really wanted to see the final episode, because there’s something so celebratory about it,” the actress explained. “So even though I wasn’t completely caught up, I did watch the finale.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Aw, it’s sweet that she wanted to see how the season ended — and whether or not her closest friends also bit the dust. (Spoiler alert: they didn’t!)</p><h3>Emily Was Touched By Fans Outpouring After Beth Died</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>As some diehard TWD fans might remember, fans were downright outraged after Beth was taken from them. In fact, many fans put together a petition demanding that the show bring her back for good — an unlikely request considering she was shot point-blank in the head.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>But, even without the petition succeeding, Emily told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY that she found their support absolutely incredible.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“For me it was very moving, it was satisfying in a certain way. I was sad that everyone felt so sad but I also felt sort of satisfied, like the people in the end ended up feeling really connected to that, and they were going to miss her,” Emily explained. “If you’ve given 3 to 4 years of your life to a show, it’s nice to feel like oh, I’m leaving, and people feel connected to this thing you made, or helped make. So I just feel really thankful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>However, Emily hopes that the fans who connected with her on TWD will follow her career — and maybe even watch her on The Flash. “It’s sad that Beth’s not back, but maybe they’ll check out new projects,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — Are you still bummed about Beth’s death?
