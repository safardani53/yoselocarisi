During the final two seasons, the six main actors each earned $1 million per episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Everything-the-Friends-Cast-Has-Said-About-Matthew-Perrys-Struggles-Through-the-Years.jpg><p class=p3>“We’re all doing the exact same amount of work,” Aniston, 52, said. “I wouldn’t have felt comfortable knowing I was making more.”</p><p class=p1>It wasn’t just&nbsp;<i>The Morning Show&nbsp;</i>star who felt equality was important. <a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a> added: “We all felt that way. I thought it was the most important thing—as we all did—that we all were equal in every single way. That was the first time that people had all stuck together in a cast. I think it was scary, probably, for productions after that.”</p><p class=p1>The cast was able to band together on this principle because they were so supportive of one another, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a> explained.&nbsp;With equal salaries, “it just got rid of bitterness,” the 57-year-old&nbsp;<i>Feel Good&nbsp;</i>actor said. “It was such a great relationship that is really rare and really lucky.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-02-at-1.35.09-PM.png><p class=p2>Their friendship extended beyond sticking together in contract negotiations.</p><p class=p1>“I think Courteney had a lot to do with it, too, because she was the most well-known,” the star of&nbsp;<i>The Comeback s</i>aid. “When we got there she was like, ‘Let’s help each other if you think something’s funny, let’s give each other notes.’”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This was a sentiment the&nbsp;</span><i>Murder Mystery&nbsp;</i>actor echoed: “It was healing. We actually kind of parented and healed and loved each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Friends-Cast-Share-BTS-Photos-From-Reunion-Special-06.jpg><p class=p2>During the interview, Aniston also revealed she’s&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s2>“buddies” with her real-life ex, <strong>Brad Pitt</strong></span></a>, and she&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s2>would have “banged”</span></a>&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>David Schwimmer</strong></a> if she had the chance.</p><p class=p2>The&nbsp;<i>Cake&nbsp;</i>star added that working on the comedy series was a&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s1>“wonderful, warm place to be”</span></a>&nbsp;but some guest stars weren’t happy to be on set, which was particularly off-putting for her.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p2>“This person was like, ‘Listen to them, just laughing at their own jokes. So stupid, not even funny,’” Aniston said. “It was just like, ‘What are you doing here? Your attitude — this is not what we’re all about.’”</p><p class=p2>The full cast of the NBC sitcom reunited this May for a televised special on HBO Max. The unscripted&nbsp;<i>Friends: The Reunion&nbsp;</i>episode was taped on the original soundstage at Warner Bros. Studio, and&nbsp;<i>Variety</i>&nbsp;reported in February 2020 that the&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s1>six actors were each paid</span></a>&nbsp;at least $2.5 million to appear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ2roZWjsbR5wpqqratdmr62rctmaGalmaG5qrvNZqeasV2auaq5yKeYrZ2UYq%2BqwNOeqaedo6h8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
