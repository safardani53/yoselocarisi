A red ruffed lemur got into the tiger enclosure and was also eaten, and a giraffe died after slipping on a smooth concrete floor.</p><p>Animal welfare charity the Captive Animals’ Protection Society called the council’s findings “the worst we have ever come across in 60 years”.</p><p>It carried out its own inspection last summer and campaign officer Maddie Taylor says: “We urge the local authority to take action by closing this appalling zoo down.”</p><p>The charity’s inspection found an emaciated kangaroo, a meerkat with skin problems and Humboldt ­penguins deprived of water on the hottest day of last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000305480482.jpg><p>Yesterday The Sun visited and found the ­penguins had plenty of water — but it was the colour of mud.</p><p>Travel website TripAdvisor is full of comments from disgruntled visitors who normally pay £16.50 per adult ticket — though yesterday the zoo had extended its free winter entry offer. Heather W posted:</p><p>“Most of the ­animals looked stressed out and ­miserable, with many who had clumps of hair missing and patches of skin that looked sore.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000305465722.jpg><p>Sarah Moorehouse wrote: “I can’t believe there are places like this still around. The animals look miserable and some look in really poor condition. Enclosures are really run down.”</p><p>And Amy McGovan said: “Avoid this place at all costs. It needs ­closing down.”</p><p>The council’s veterinary advisor Dr Matthew Brash, who inspected the zoo, reported: “It was particularly upsetting to see the lack of bedding for the baby rhino, which clearly demonstrated that there was nobody in charge on a day-to-day basis for the welfare of the animals.” The report explained that young rhinos can suffer hypothermia from lying on a cold concrete floor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict0003054655591.jpg><p>Dr Brash’s inspection found many of the zoo’s animals were given little protection against the cold Lake ­District climate. In 2015 three nyala — spiral-horned East African antelope — died within a week of their arrival and another two have since died, while last January four Inca terns, native to Peru, died — all due to cold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000305689783.jpg><p>Tortoises were found huddled together under heat lamps because their tank was not warm enough.</p><p>Animals in the Africa House, which are by nature used to warmer climes, were kept in the cold. The report said: “If the temperature dropped and remained low, the giraffes would use energy reserves to keep warm which they can’t maintain, which ultimately means they could die.”</p><p>It continued: “Mr Gill did not believe the animals need heating but a structure was now in place.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000305689766.jpg><p>The council’s report did make clear some improvements had been made.</p><p>The tiger fencing, for example, had been strengthened.</p><p>In 2013, a Sumatran tiger called Padang fatally mauled 24-year-old zookeeper Sarah McClay. The zoo was fined £450,000 and the tiger was put down in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000305689597.jpg><p>It was not the first fine for lax standards. And despite Mr Gill ­owning a zoo licence since 1994, in 2001 an industrial tribunal ordered him to pay £30,000 compensation to former zookeeper Lara Kitson after he ordered her to clamber up a ­ladder to feed raw meat to the tigers while she was pregnant. She complained that scaling the ladder would put her baby at risk but claimed Mr Gill suggested she have an abortion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000000485909-e1488407625378.jpg><p>In 1997, a three-ton white rhino went on a terrifying rampage through the zoo and had to be shot dead.</p><p>Mr Gill was fined £10,000 for failing to secure the enclosure.</p><p>He now claims he has taken a step back from managing the zoo and instead leases it to the Cumbria Zoo Company.</p><p>Last July, after a council licensing renewal meeting, he vowed he would no longer be involved in running it, yet three weeks later four new directors resigned and Mr and Mrs Gill were appointed sole directors.</p><p>The Council had rejected his application to renew his licence due to management and health and safety concerns, but ruled it could stay open while he reapplied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000305664997.jpg><p>But the latest council report said: “The chief concern is not the deaths, or even the causes but the fact that David Gill accepts these losses and does not see a problem with it.”</p><p>A spokesman for Mr Gill said: “The current arrangement sees the entire zoo site leased to Cumbria Zoo</p><p>Company Limited. Mr Gill remains the licence holder but otherwise has stepped away from all trading and management activities.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000242853133.jpg><p>Karen Brewer, chief executive of Cumbria Zoo Company Limited, said they were committed to treating all animals with respect, providing “environments that focus on the animals’ physical and behavioural needs”.</p><p>Councillors will decide whether to renew the licence next week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4Z5hJduaWirlZqxunnLop2eZZ%2BberW0xGakoqScnryvrcirnGanp6Oys3nWoaZmpJmrsqV5yK1krqhdlsButNSnm6udlKh6sLKMmqWipZGhwG6wyJ6bZpmemXq0wcWfnKudlGK2r3nAqaeapJyeu6h5wqilnaGknryvv4yaq2arn6rBqXnLmqKeq12orqet0aJks6efZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
