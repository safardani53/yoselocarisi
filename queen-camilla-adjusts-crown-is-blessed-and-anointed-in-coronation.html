Amen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Queen-Camilla-Is-Blessed-and-Anointed-Alongside-King-Charles-III-During-Coronation-Ceremony.jpg><p class=p1>Shortly after the headpiece was placed atop Camilla’s head, she quickly <a href=#>straightened its positioning</a> as the ceremony continued. Camilla then flashed a sweet smile at her husband.</p><p>The official oil used in <a href=#>the ceremony</a> was crafted with olives harvested from local groves at the Monastery of the Ascension and the Monastery of Mary Magdalene, where Charles’ grandmother — and <a href=#>Prince Philip</a>‘s mother — Princess Alice is buried. The oil itself was inspired by the one used to <a href=#>anoint Charles’ mother</a>, <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, during <a href=#>her official coronation in 1953</a>.</p><p class=p1>When the ceremony kicked off early on Saturday, Camilla was accompanied by three of her grandchildren. Gus Lopes, Louis Lopes and Freddy Parker Bowles — the respective kids of her two children, <strong>Laura Lopes</strong> and<strong> Tom Parker Bowles</strong> — who served as her <a href=#>Pages of Honor</a>. The 13-year-olds all held onto their grandmother’s stately robe during <a href=#>the Westminster Abbey procession</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Camilla-Adjusts-Crown-During-Coronation-Blessing.jpg><p>While Saturday’s coronation is the <a href=#>official ceremony for Charles’ reign</a>, he assumed his role as sovereign and Camilla became the queen consort immediately after <a href=#>Elizabeth’s passing</a> at age 96 in September 2022. Before her death, the late monarch previously <a href=#>declared her hope</a> that Camilla would <a href=#>inherit the title of queen consort</a> once Charles took the throne.</p><p>“When, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me,” the longest reigning queen wrote in a February 2022 statement during her <a href=#>Platinum Jubilee celebration</a>. “And it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.”</p><p>Following her passing, Camilla <a href=#>spoke fondly of her mother-in-law</a> while attending a royal reception for those who entered the Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Camilla-Adjusts-Crown-During-Coronation-Blessing-2.jpg><p>“I cannot begin without paying tribute to my dear mother-in-law, Her late Majesty, who is much in our thoughts today and who is so greatly missed by us all,” she told attendees in November 2021. “Throughout her remarkable reign, its vision to improve the lives and prospects of all Commonwealth citizens remained, as you know, very close to her heart.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The royal continued: “Over the past few months, my husband and I have drawn immense comfort from the messages of condolence that we have received, and continue to receive, from the four corners of the world. They have reminded us that the written word has a unique ability to connect, to heal, to reassure and to offer hope, even in the midst of grief.”</p><p>Charles and Camilla <a href=#>tied the knot in 2005</a>, nearly 10 years after his divorce from the late <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> was finalized in 1996. (Charles welcomed sons <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> with the late royal in 1982 and 1984, respectively.) Camilla, for her part, was previously married to British Army officer <a href=#><strong>Andrew Parker Bowles</strong></a> with whom she shares her <a href=#>two children</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaqrZWau26vwKagpaSRYq6lttSsq6xlk6e8uLqMoqpmmpyawLSxw2aYp5xdlruwtc2tnJ1lmaN6pLvRqKWarJmku3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
