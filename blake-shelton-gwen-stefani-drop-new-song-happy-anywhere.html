In December 2019, the pair dropped the country ballad “Nobody But You.” Following the track’s debut, the twosome landed in the No. 1 spot on Billboard Country Airplay Chart.</p><p>After hitting the studio to record the hit single, Shelton opened up about his experience working alongside Stefani in a behind-the-scenes clip <a href=#>posted to his YouTube page</a>. He revealed how impressed he was by the No Doubt frontwoman’s work ethic.</p><p>“The thing that I think that I’m blown away by with Gwen is just how hard she works when she gets in the studio,” he explained in May. “She’s not willing to take anything less than greatness, you know, and she’s willing to put in the work.”</p><p>The “God’s Country” crooner added, “I mean, I don’t care if it means she’s gotta get in there and sing until she completely loses her voice. I don’t think Gwen knows how great of a vocalist she really is.”</p><p>Shelton and Stefani began dating in 2015, after enduring their respective divorces from <a href=#><strong>Miranda Lambert</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Gavin Rossdale</strong></a> in the summer of 2015.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As their romance continued to progress, Shelton grew closer to <a href=#>Stefani’s three sons — Kingston, 14, Zuma, 11, and Apollo, 6</a> — who she shares with the 54-year-old Rush rocker. “<a href=#>He is a good dad, actually</a>,” the Grammy winner said on the Today show in September 2019. “He’s been helping me out a lot. I literally get to the point where I’m like, ‘You’ve got to get home. Come help!’ It’s hard. I have three boys.”</p><p>In June, a source told Us that the duo <a href=#>are ready to take the next step in their relationship</a> by getting married. The “Hollaback Girl” singer “wants to have the wedding as soon as social distancing guidelines are lifted” amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmlmZuaerS0xKWrqKZdnMSmuoysq56ekaO2brDRqKdmppWserS7zaBkoZmgpcZurc2yrqGdopp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
