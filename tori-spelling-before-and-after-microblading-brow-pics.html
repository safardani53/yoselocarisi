And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donna Martin</a> was on point for that decade,” she wrote. “Plus, no one told me The Brow Would Be Back! And, in a BIG WAY!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tori-Spelling-Microblading-Inline-1.jpg><p>So as she tweezed over the years to keep the shape, she revealed she was just never able to get them back to their full potential. That is, until a mistake forced her to give <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">microblading</a> a try.</p><p>“About three weeks ago I blew it and made a hole in one of my brows while trying to tweeze them. That’s when I knew I just had to go for it,” the 46-year-old wrote.</p><p>She turned to friend and makeup artist Niki Metz to fix them after years of Metz telling Spelling that microblading would be “life changing.”</p><p>“Well, she was right,” the actress continued. “You have pretty much changed my life!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tori-Spelling-Microblading-Inline-2.jpg><p>In the second and third picture there are side-by-sides of the blonde beauty’s brows before and after the treatment. While the actress’ beautiful arch shape remained, the brows definitely appear fuller, sharper and over all more on-trend for 2019.</p><p>“I’m obsessed with the beautiful #microblading she did on me,” Spelling concluded in her caption. “Who knew brows could literally boost your self confidence! I feel so good about myself right now. Thank you my friend! So natural. So easy. So brilliant.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m8s7WMrKeepJyeu6h5wZ6dqKqVYq6vsIyana2domK6qq%2FRqJmlmZSeu6h5waumsGWgnrC0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
