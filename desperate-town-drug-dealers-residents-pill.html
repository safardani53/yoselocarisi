It is a melting pot of culture, arguably one of the most diverse communities in Wales.</p><p>But, in recent years, Pill has become a <a href=#>magnet for drug dealers</a> and prostitutes, lured by the huge rise in the number of houses of multiple occupation (HMOs).</p><p>The crumbling, once-grand properties are bordered by land supposedly ear-marked for development, which in reality have turned into patches of wasteland used to dump rubbish.</p><p>Locals complain the boarded-up sites are <a href=#>crawling with rats</a>.
