Heaven smirked toward the camera as she held her hands in a prayer position, rocking a long sleeved shirt and denim skirt. She was surrounded by her stepmom <strong>Eniko</strong>, as well as<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> siblings <strong>Hendrix</strong>, 15, and <strong>Kenzo</strong>, 5,</a> who all appeared to make sad faces. Eniko, 38, and Kevin are also parents to two year old <strong>Kaori</strong>, who didn’t appear to be present for move in day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The college move has been in the works since <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Heaven graduated</a> from Sierra Canyon High School in May. She looked so grown up in a navy blue cap and gown as she accepted her diploma at the prestigious school, also attended by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bronny James</strong></a>, followed by a family dinner at Soho House’s Little Beach House in Malibu. Heaven was stylish in a white cocktail style dress and gold lace-up sandals for the celebratory evening, commemorating the next phase of life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“It’s not about me….It has always been about them!!!!!!! I am so proud of my little girl,” Kevin wrote when Heaven graduated. “I am just as proud of my niece sanny for being an amazing example for Heav….Sanny was the first in our family to go to college and graduate…Now My little girl is heading in that same direction,” he also said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Iron Sharpens Iron….it always has and always will.
