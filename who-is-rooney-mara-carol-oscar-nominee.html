Her Oscar nomination for the 2016 award show is NOT her first nod from the Academy.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Rooney is no rookie when it comes to award shows, in fact, she was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her breakout role of Lisbeth Salander in the 2011 film,&nbsp;<i><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>.</i> Unfortunately for Rooney, she did not win either award, but getting nominated for Best Actress is quite the feat when you’re only 26. Still&nbsp;we’re not surprised she gained critical acclaim for her portrayal of Lisbeth. After all, Rooney put everything she had into that character, including dying and cutting her hair, having her ears pierced four times, receiving a brow and a nipple piercing, and bleaching her eyebrows. Such dedication!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>[jwplatform MpjlEawS]</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>2. Her family has crazy NFL ties.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>How random is this — Rooney’s mother’s family founded the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, while her father’s family founded the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Giants</a>. Both families have maintained at least partial ownership of their teams since they were founded. In fact, Rooney’s father and paternal uncles have high ranking positions within the Giants organization; her uncle <strong>John Mara</strong>&nbsp;being the president and CEO of the team. Rooney has even described football as “the glue that holds our family together.” Aw!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>3. Engaging in charity work is one of her biggest passions.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Rooney may be a two-time Oscar nominated actress, but clearly she doesn’t let any of the fame get to her head. And although acting is a huge passion of hers, so is giving back! Rooney founded the charity called Faces of Kibera, which aims to provide housing, food, and medical care for orphans in a specific slum located in Nairobi, Kenya. In 2011, Faces of Kibera merged with Uweza Foundation, and Rooney currently&nbsp;serves as the president of the board of directors for the foundation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>4. She was almost the lead in Zero Dark Thirty.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Rooney actually landed the coveted role of “Maya” in <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kathryn Bigelow’s</a></strong> action film Zero Dark Thirty. However, due to scheduling conflicts, the star had to drop out of the project in early 2012. Who was she replaced by? None other than <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jessica Chastain</a></strong>, who’s career seriously took off after taking the part.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>5. In 2015 she played the role of Tiger Lily in Pan, a role that she now regrets taking.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Rooney was harshly criticized for portraying Tiger Lily in Pan, a role that was written for a Native American. People accused her of “whitewashing,” and to express their concerns, activists created the hashtag #NotYourTigerLily in protest. Since, Rooney has spoken out, saying,&nbsp;“I really hate, hate, hate that I am on that side of the whitewashing conversation. I really do.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>It’s official, Rooney Mara is one of the hottest celebs in Hollywood right now, and we can’t wait to watch her strut her stuff at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oscars</a> on Feb. 28. We’re rooting for you, Rooney!</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of Rooney?
