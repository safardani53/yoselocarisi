Clara (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@cgillum8</a>) shared in a video that after she came home from work to find her pumpkin broken with the insides exposed, she found something totally unexpected.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Clara shows what's left of the pumpkin and explains that the inside of it looks like sensitive documents that have no place inside a decoration from a craft store. It appears that wherever this particular Hobby Lobby decor item was manufactured was done so using paper that probably should have been destroyed. And now everyone wants a Hobby Lobby pumpkin of their own.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman's papier mache pumpkin from Hobby Lobby was made using sensitive documents.</h2><p>Let's not make this into a whole thing, OK? As in, let's not make a Hobby Lobby pumpkin challenge on TikTok, because if you're anything like me, you already have way too much Halloween and fall decor in your home right now anyway.</p><p>But it's certainly hard not to want to seek out one of these papier mache pumpkins yourself to see if all of them are made in this way. What other paper documents did Hobby Lobby use?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I have a trial balance from a special education fund in here and their debt is over $3 million," Clara says in her video, as she reads off the documents inside of her papier mache pumpkin. "I have account numbers inside of it. Um, I don't feel like I should have this information. Like, Hobby Lobby, what are you doing here?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One comment under the video suggests that a paper shredding company is actually selling pallets of documents to craft stores like Hobby Lobby. And if that's the case, then that's a whole other issue on top of sensitive documents being used to create random decor items.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Now, people want to get their hands on a Hobby Lobby pumpkin themselves.</h2><p>While most of those who commented on Clara's video are simply shook that she found something so random inside of her papier mache pumpkin, others want pumpkins now too so they can see if there are other documents inside of those.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"Is this an ad for Hobby Lobby? Because now I want one of those pumpkins," one TikTok user commented. And, I mean, I get it.</p><p>"I'm about to go buy a papier mache pumpkin from Hobby Lobby just to see what I get," another user commented.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a way, this is recycling at its finest, but something tells me Hobby Lobby could have found a better source of material than something that no one other than the documents' original owners should probably ever see.</p><p>But Hobby Lobby may not be the first company to recycle something and use it inside another product. Another person who commented under the video claimed that they once found part of a Lucky Charms box inside a Yahtzee dice cup. Though to be fair, it's not exactly the same thing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>All I'm going to say is that if you are really that pressed to get a papier mache pumpkin of your own, you may want to act fast. Because something tells me these are about to fly off the shelves, either from customers, or employees under direction to do so.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbyjrthmo6iakq56tLHNrKCtoaaaeqW7wq6knqakqHqxrc%2BinKtlnZawqbGMqaymqJueuw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
