It is also very sad as well. We lost a community. People scattered.</p><p>"Today it's a ghost village; It's quite eerie, as I remember it as it was. It's sad, so very sad. It was a very happy community. Very close-knitted.</p><p>Rosalyn spoke of a landslip which careered into one of her neighbours' houses.</p><h3><a href=#>LEFT TO NATURE Haunting photos show the world’s most forgotten places… from moss-covered villages to abandoned car graveyards</a></h3><p>She said: "I can remember hearing a noise and walking out the front door and seeing a double decker bus reversing back down the hill and all the mud was coming to meet it.</p><p>"We were fortunate that we didn't have a gate in the wall at the back of our garden, next door wasn't so lucky and it went right through the house.</p><p>"It took a long time to clean it all up; the road was closed for quite a while."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000350271559.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000350271292.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000350271283.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000350271056.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000350271020.jpg><p>Buildings in the village were demolished as a result of the landslide and the area was closed off.</p><p>Another former resident Gareth Roderick, 79, said: "There was a quarry and a spring on the hillside behind the house a few doors away and the pipes became blocked and the water came down.</p><p>"It caused the mountain to come down and it pushed the house over. It came very quietly.</p><p>"It had been squeezing against the house all morning. There was no noise at all.
