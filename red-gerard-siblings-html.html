Surprisingly, that's not the case.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Gerard is the sixth of seven siblings that include a&nbsp;filmmaker, pro snowboarder, and a sister who's got her own business and over three million Instagram followers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Red Gerard Grew Up With Six Siblings</h2><p>"There's 23 years between them," Gerard's mother Jen told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">12 News</a>,&nbsp;"I think in a large family you almost need to find your little niche." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She affirmed that all of her kids&nbsp;had found worthwhile things to keep themselves busy.&nbsp;</p><p>"Everyone is like Red you realize you will never be where your sister is," Jen joked.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>While every one of Gerard's siblings are&nbsp;established professionals in their respective fields, his sister Tieghan would be the one that has a claim to fame comparable to the Olympic snowboarder.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Tieghan is a food blogger and chef that commands a massive following on Instagram—3.7 million followers as of this writing. In contrast, Gerard's following on the platform is a humble 243 thousand units.&nbsp;</p><h2>Red Gerard Began Snowboarding at 2 Years of Age</h2><p>Gerard has been competing with the US team when he was 13 years old and has been traveling the world, competing ever since.</p><p>He even represented the US at the South Korea Seol Olympics when he was a teenager.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Gerard is undeniably a wunderkind, but his siblings have supported him throughout the whole journey.&nbsp;</p><p>He began snowboarding when he was 2. Still, it was just a passing hobby until a few years later when he moved from Cleveland, Ohio, to the snowy slopes of&nbsp;Silverthorne, Colorado.</p><p>"My mom actually had, I don't know what you call it, like a midlife crisis," Gerard confided to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sierra Sun</a>,&nbsp;"Like, 'I've got to get out of Cleveland.'" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Red Gerard's Siblings Set Up a Terrain&nbsp;Park</h2><p>Since their move to Silverthorne, Gerard's siblings, mostly his brothers, decided to install rails in their backyard.&nbsp;</p><p>By the next winter, they had a rope tow set up for their terrain park. They used an old dirt bike for the towing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Soon enough, it became the perfect ground for Gerard to hone his snowboarding skills alongside about 30 of his friends over long hours.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>When I first got the rope, I was on this routine for two months where I’d go snowboarding and then I come home and just ride the rope tow till nighttime. It was insane. I never really thought I’d actually learn tricks in the backyard. And I actually ended up learning a lot, which was amazing.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Red Gerard Is a Wunderkind</h2><p>However, Jen told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NBC Sports</a>&nbsp;had to make the local kids sign release forms because snowboarding wasn't exactly safe. She revealed the kids had more than a few injuries and a lot of concussions.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Understandably, she had to deal with quite a few incidents in the park. At times, she would even have to pull Gerard out of the park so he'd complete his homework.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Later on, his brothers began making YouTube videos to showcase their little brother's skills. Not long after, Gerard got a sponsorship from Burton. Mind you, Gerard wasn't even a teenager at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time he was fourteen, he was being backed by&nbsp;Red Bull, Von Zipper, Woodward at Copper, High Cascade Snowboard Camp, ProTec, Celtek, Cobra Dogs, Stance, and Hobo. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqVmXqosdGaqZ1lo56vrbXNoKpnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
