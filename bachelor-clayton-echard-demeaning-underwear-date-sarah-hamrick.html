Is this what <a href=#>#TheBachelor</a> produces think is sexy, shocking, or entertaining? Doing a scavenger hunt in your underwear is so regressive and unnecessary? Like what the hell. Maybe the producers grade 6 daughter wrote this challenge... <a href=#>#awkward</a>"</p><p>While a second person agreed tweeting: "They went from a group date talking about body insecurities to running around in public in underwear to a baywatch photoshoot…am I the only one who thinks that’s wrong?! <a href=#>#TheBachelor</a>"</p><p>Others felt the same way as similar tweets flooded in.</p><p>"I would absolutely throw hands if <a href=#>#thebachelor</a> made me run around in public in underwear without the chance to pick out my own skivvies"</p><p>"Only <a href=#>#TheBachelor</a> would have a date where they essentially force the contestants to open up about their body dysmorphia immediately followed by a date where they make the bachelor and his date run around downtown LA in their underwear while zooming in on their bodies"</p><p>"the bachelor franchise acting like it’s ~*changed*~ & now they have two people running around los angeles in underwear."</p><p>The backlash continued with another posting: "8pm This Episode: Women sharing that they've had serious body issues and struggled with society's expectations of what they should look like 9pm This Episode: Back-to-back dates women are forced down to their underwear/bathing suits publicly <a href=#>#TheBachelor</a><a href=#>#TheBachelorABC</a>"</p><p>And another who didn't feel the challenge was appropriate said: "IT DOESN’T MATTER IF HER UNDERWEAR LOOKS LIKE A SWIMSUIT. YOU’RE MISSING THE POINT. No one should have to run around in public wearing something that makes them feel uncomfortable. <a href=#>#TheBachelor</a>"</p><p>The revealing first date was ironic to fans as previously in the episode, Clayton went on a group date with other women who each got vulnerable about their insecurities with their bodies.</p><h2>'MY FUTURE WIFE IS HERE'</h2><p>Fans are getting to know the <a href=#>Bachelor star</a> on a closer level after first meeting him on <a href=#>Michelle Young's</a>&nbsp;season of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Bachelorette</a>&nbsp;which recently concluded.</p><p>Unfortunately, he did not win over Michelle's heart as he was sent home during the sixth rose ceremony.</p><p>However, producers fell in love with the former Seattle Seahawks player prior to his run as a contestant as it appeared Echard's season of The Bachelor had already started production.</p><p>Photos leaked of Echard with a camera crew, which was published by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>&nbsp;on September 15, 2021 - a month before Michelle's season aired.</p><p>After the photos leaked, sources told&nbsp;<a href=#>Variety</a>&nbsp;the Missouri native is in fact the show's next star.</p><p>In the first teaser for the Bachelor's 26th season, Echard said: "I'm just a Midwest guy from Missouri that just wants to find love.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"And I believe more than anything that my future wife is here."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707418001.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000680090260.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000680090249.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bachelor fans slam Clayton Echard as too 'boring' to be the next star after lackluster debut on Bachelorette</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZWiFc4SQaJmam5iaubC%2BjJyjmrGkpLtuscKhmKucXZmyrrHAp6Cnn12qu6Wx0bCcmqpdma61sYysmKuZmGK1ornRopqkZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
