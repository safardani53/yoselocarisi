Stay close.’</p><p>"And then I turned and walked off towards the village.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000339448597.jpg><p>“I turned and they were all looking and waving and I waved back. And that was about it really.”</p><p>Production notes read: "Testimonies from friends, family, police officers, key witnesses and experts in criminology are combined with an interview with Sarah's mother, to illustrate the tragic toll the case took on those closest to the victim."<br></p><h2>What happened to Sarah Payne and when did she disappear?</h2><p>Sarah Evelyn Isobel Payne was eight-years-old when she was <a href=# rel=noopener>abducted and murdered</a> as she played hide and seek with her brothers in a cornfield near her grandparent's home in July 2000.</p><p>After 17 days of searching her body was found in a field near Oulborough, around 15 miles from where she disappeared in Kingston Gorse.</p><p>Sarah’s brother Lee — now 30 and a father of one — was 13 when he ran to look for Sarah and saw killer Roy Whiting’s van speeding off.</p><p>Her other brother Luke, 12, and sister Charlotte, six, had already run to their grandparents’ house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000339448596.jpg><h2>Who is murderer Roy Whiting?</h2><p>Paedophile <a href=#>Whiting</a>, 57, is serving 40 years for murdering eight-year-old Sarah Payne in 2000. He stays in his cell at Wakefield Prison most of the time for fear of attack by other lags.</p><p>The former mechanic has been slashed with a razor and stabbed with a sharpened toilet brush.</p><p>Earlier this year he was battered with a flask by another prisoner.</p><p>He is reportedly spending his life sentence building intricate models with matchsticks in his cell.</p><p>The monster has been nicknamed Matchstick Man after making replicas of St Paul’s Cathedral, Big Ben and a Lancaster bomber.</p><p>In 1995 he abducted and sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl. He admitted charges of abduction and indecent assault, and was sentenced to four years in prison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict0003394485922.jpg><h2>What is Sarah's Law?</h2><p>The child sex offender disclosure scheme in England and Wales (also sometimes known as "Sarah’s Law"), allows anyone to formally ask the police if someone with access to a child has a record for child sexual offences.</p><p>Police will reveal details confidentially to the person most able to protect the child (usually parents, carers or guardians) if they think it is in the child’s interests.</p><p>Scotland run a similar nationwide scheme called&nbsp;Keeping children safe&nbsp;which allows parents, carers and guardians of children under 18 years old to ask the police if someone who has contact with their child has a record for sexual offences against children, or other offences that could put that child at risk.</p><p>No such scheme is formally available in Northern Ireland. However, information on sex offenders can be, and is, shared in a controlled way by the police where necessary for the purposes of child protection or risk management.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most Read in TV & Showbiz</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhsYGmBcoOPaKqaqpGderGt2KecZpldory1tMSrqmarpKS%2FunnCoZinppWhenZ506ilop%2BYqXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
