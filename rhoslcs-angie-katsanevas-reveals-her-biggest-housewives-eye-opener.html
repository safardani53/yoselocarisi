I was hoping that everyone would have the same mentality as me, but it’s a little eye-opener that sadly you have to be cautious with some people.”</p><p>Angie initially appeared on RHOSLC during season 2, becoming a regular cast member when <a href=#>season 4</a> debuted in September. Fans have seen her clash with <strong>Meredith Marks</strong> this season as rumors about Angie’s husband, <strong>Shawn Trujillo</strong>, having affairs with men take center stage. Tension began to build after Angie crashed Meredith’s Palm Springs trip, and <a href=#>the drama hasn’t slowed down</a> since.</p><p>“I say your jewelry’s dusty, and this is where you take it? Look, here’s the bottom line. If people need to hitch their wagon to me to be relevant, let them.” Angie said in an October episode. “Everyone in Salt Lake City knows the truth. These rumors about infidelity have never existed.”</p><p>Despite the rumors about her personal life, Angie is trying to stay above it all. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is don’t believe everything because people will say anything to be relevant,” she told Us.</p><p>When asked about Meredith’s sporadic use of different accents — viewers were taken aback by the sound of Meredith’s voice during a disastrous dinner in Palm Springs — Angie claimed, “Meredith has multiple personalities. … Today I’m British, today I’m Greek, today I’m American. I don’t know, it’s fun, good for her. Lots of role playing going on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RHOSLC-s-Angie-Katsanevas-Has-Had-to-Learn-That-Everyone-Is-Not-Your-Friend-as-a-Housewife-.jpg><p>She went on to speculate that alcohol might contribute to Meredith’s bizarre behavior. “Look, I stay pretty sober while filming and just in general, so I don’t know if it’s the wine,” Angie told Us. “I don’t know what it is that brings on these accents and these personalities.”</p><p>Angie’s spontaneous arrival in Palm Springs was all in good fun, but she will “never again” be showing up to any trips uninvited. “I wish people had the same sense of humor that I do,” Angie told Us. “Look, I’m all down for the fun, and next time, hopefully, I’ll be the hostess and I will include everyone.”</p><p>While she has certainly made her fair share of frenemies on the show, Angie has also made some unbreakable bonds with her costars. “Not everyone’s your friend,” Angie said. “But I have my friends by my side, and I’m so grateful for that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp6OhsLR5wKeeop1doK61v8CnnK%2BZo2K%2FpsLEmqOsZZiav26uyKCenqukYrWwwdKerqKulah6psXEZqapnZ6av3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
