They can be worn at any time of the year and the material the shawl is made of will most likely determine its use. Lighter materials make the shoulder wrap great for summer evenings after sunset when it starts to cool down, while thicker knits can be worn over a turtleneck for added warmth in winter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Since shawls generally only cover your shoulders and part of your arms and upper back, they aren’t sufficient on their own to use instead of a jacket in extremely cold temperatures. Plus, shoulder wraps come in a magnitude of varieties.</span></p><p><span>Here are some tips for choosing a high-quality shawl this season.</span></p><h3>Choose Colors to Suit Your Complexion</h3><p><span>Since shawls are worn close to your face, it is important to choose a color that enhances your skin tone. If you have light skin, steer away from light colors that can dull your complexion. Opt for crimson, orange, brown, jade, emerald green, and darker blue shades. Matching a shawl with the color of your eyes can make your eyes pop especially with blue and green shades.</span></p><p><span>If you have dark skin, you’ll want to opt for lighter colors. Dark shades of purple, brown, and black can hide your features while lighter colors will create a contrast.</span></p><p><span>Wearing the right color scarf for your complexion allows you to wear an outfit in colors that would otherwise not suit you. For example, if you would like to wear black for a chic, slim style, but have avoided it because black tends to make you look pale, you can now pair that cute black dress with a suitably colored shawl and look fabulous. The color next to your face is what makes a difference and will inevitably determine whether the ensemble works with your skin tone or not.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Prints and Patterns</h3><p><span>Contrary to popular belief, there are times when pattern-on-pattern works. Just as men can successfully pair a printed tie with a striped or checked shirt, shawls with pattern designs can pair well with printed apparel. One of the best ways to do this is by layering big and small-scale patterns. Pairing a small-scale printed blouse with a large-scale patterned shawl allows the small <a href=#>blouse</a> patterns to work as a neutral. Make sure to keep the colors complimentary to avoid overkill.</span></p><p><span>Brightly patterned shawls are great to jazz up plain and monochromatic outfits, while neutral colors can transform your outfit from a daytime to an evening look.</span></p><h3>Fabric and Texture</h3><p><span>The fabric and texture of your shawl choice are important for a number of reasons. Different fabrics offer various levels of insulation and warmth, and some materials require special washing and dry care. Most shawls should be hand washed or washed on a delicate machine cycle with a very light detergent or even shampoo. They are best dried on a flat surface after the water has been lightly squeezed out but not twisted too vigorously.</span></p><p><span>Since you are wearing the shawl around your neck and near your face, you also want to ensure that it does not cause any irritation against your skin, itchiness, or flare-up of allergies. Various wool types provide a lot of warmth but some can be chunky and itchy. Silk scarves are very elegant and great for multiple seasons. Blended materials, such as acrylic, make the fabric cost-effective, lightweight, warm, and durable, while viscose is breathable, smooth, and drapes well. All-natural cotton is less likely to cause sensitive or allergic skin reactions.</span></p><h3>Double-Sided</h3><p><span>Depending on how you are planning to wear the scarf, you may want to check that the design is reversible and doesn’t have a distinct front and back. This allows you to wear it with either side showing without looking like you are wearing it back-to-front.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Ways to Wear a Shawl</h3><h4><span>Traditional</span></h4><p><span>Drape the fabric over your shoulders and part of your arms to keep warm or as a style accessory.</span></p><h4><span>Scarf</span></h4><p><span>Gather the width of the shawl to form a long scarf. Drape the scarf around your neck. Pull one side down a little to give it an uneven length in front. Wrap the long side around your neck again, bringing it back to the front. Alternatively, leave one end hanging at the back.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Headscarf</span></h4><p><span>Place the shawl over your head. Drape each end across the opposite shoulder to lightly frame your face.</span></p><h3><span>Other Uses</span></h3><p><span>Shawls can also be used as a beach skirt or wrap. Since they fold up into a small size, they are extremely convenient to put into your bag when traveling and just drape over your shoulders during a flight or at chilly airports. Due to their softness and slight stretch quality, shawls have also been used as baby slings.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwrc%2BpmKudnGTAqa3WpWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
