Silver was working the awards show as a makeup artist. Upon their first meeting, the former esthetician wasn’t familiar with Van Dyke’s previous projects.</p><p>“I remember seeing Dick at the catering table with his bow tie and his big smile. Right when I sat down, he was sitting next to me. He said, ‘Hi, I’m Dick.’ The first thing I asked him was, ‘Weren’t you in Mary Poppins?’ I wasn’t sure,” she confessed to the <a href=#>Huffington Post</a> in October 2013. “I knew who he was but I wasn’t sure why I knew who he was. I was not familiar with all his work. He has so much work I can’t believe I missed it.”</p><p>The twosome, who <a href=#>have a 46-year age difference</a>, hit it off and Van Dyke went on to <a href=#>hire her for other projects</a> he was working on at the time. The pair’s connection <a href=#>wouldn’t turn romantic</a> until years later.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In February 2012, the couple tied the knot on <a href=#>Leap Day</a> in a private ceremony in Malibu. At the time of their wedding, Van Dyke was 86 and Silver was 40. The Chitty Chitty Bang Bang star, for his part, was previously married to Margerie Willett from 1948 to 1976. The duo <a href=#>shared four children</a>: Christian, Barry, Stacy and Carrie Beth. Willet died in 2008.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Van Dyke and Silver’s relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksaqvymatmqZdmcassYyapZ1lp56zpnnAq6OeppViwKq41Z6prGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tbXMnqOippVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
