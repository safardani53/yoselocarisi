However, Suns waived Jackson on October 30.</p><p>He then went on to play in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) for La Crosse Bobcats over two on-and-off seasons.</p><p>While with the Bobcats, he averaged 2.7 points in 12.7 minutes per game.</p><p>Similarly, in 1998 he played four games for the Sydney Kings in NBA Australia.</p><p>To hone his skills and advance in basketball, he further played professionally in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela.</p><p>Despite being drafted in the late 90s in the NBA, Stephen did not play until the 2000-01 season in the league.</p><p>Then 2001 season saw him play with the New Jersey Nets.</p><p>Even though he played 77 games with 40 starts, the Nets did not retain him, and that was when the San Antonio Spurs signed him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Stehen-Bobcats-scaled.jpg><p>Jackson helped the Spurs win their second NBA title during the team’s run in the 2003 NBA Playoffs.</p><p>He averaged 12.8 points per game, making him the team’s third-leading scorer.</p><p>The same year he rejected the Spur’s contract extension and signed a two-year deal with the Hawks.</p><p>After the 2003-04 season, he was traded to the Pacers.</p><p>On January 2007, the Pacers traded Jackson to the Golden State Warriors.</p><p>He additionally played for Charlotte Bobcats and Milwaukee Bucks and returned to Spurs for a brief and finally retired following the 2013-2014 season with the Clippers.</p><p>Jackson announced his retirement on July 22, 2015.

Because of unhealthy spending habits, family members wanting their piece of the pie, and unnecessary purchases mainly drive these kinds of situations.</p><h3>First Pay Check</h3><p>We all are familiar with <a href=#>Shaquille O’Neal</a>’s story. He spent his signing bonus of $1 million in a matter of hours.

He recently revealed that the majority of his decision-making came from never being exposed to such money and the right financial advisors.</p><p>&nbsp;Luckily for Stephen, his financial decision-making has drastically improved over time. Otherwise, he would have squandered his $68.6 million career earnings in a spending spree.</p><h3>Contracts</h3><p>In 2000, Jackson signed a $316,969 one-year deal with the New Jersey Nets.</p><p>And after a few low-value contract extensions, he hit the jackpot with Indiana Pacers. On July 15, 2004, Jackson signed a six-year $38.25 million contract with the team as part of a sign-and-trade.</p><p>This was his largest career contract and came with an average annual salary of $6.37 million.</p><p>Similarly, when he was traded to the Warriors, he signed a three-year $28 million contract with the team on November 17, 2008.</p><p>According to the contract, he received an average annual salary of $9.25 million.</p><p>All in all, Jackson made $68.6 million from NBA salary with different teams over 14 seasons.</p><h2>Stephen Jackson | Legal Issues & Controversies</h2><p>When you are rich and famous, controversies follow you everywhere.</p><p>Stephen has had his share of controversy and legal issues.</p><p>In 2004 and 2006, the shooting guard pled guilty to felony criminal recklessness.</p><p>He was charged with assault, two counts of battery, and disorderly conduct.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020 Jackson pissed off some of the most decorated players in the NBA after he defended the Eagles wide receiver, <a href=#>DeSean Jackson</a>, for sharing anti-Semitic posts on his social media.</p><p>He received a lot of criticism for his legendary NBA players, such as <a href=#>Charles Barkley</a> and <a href=#>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</a></p><p>Jackson later apologized for his comments.</p><h2>Stephen Jackson | Personal Life</h2><p>The former NBA player Stephen Jackson has been married to Renata Elizabeth White since 2009.</p><p>He was formerly engaged to Imani Showalter, with whom Jackson shares two children; Camron Jackson and Taylor Jackson.</p><p>Imani was a cast member of the 1st season of Basketball Wives: LA.</p><p>According to Jackson, he broke up their engagement because of the prenup agreement issues.</p><p>He said that the two had previously agreed to sign the agreement, but when the documents arrived, Showalter delayed signing the papers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Stephen-Jackson-Daughter.jpg><p>Furthermore, Jackson follows Islam.
