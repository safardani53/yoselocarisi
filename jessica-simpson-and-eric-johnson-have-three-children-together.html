The singer released a carousel of photographs from the Barbie Dream House-themed celebration hosted in honor of three-year-old Birdie Mae on Instagram last Tuesday.</p><p>Simpson, who spent a lot of money on the event, said in one of her Instagram photos thanking the event planning companies that helped her put the party together:</p><p>“Birdie is everyone’s favorite person, and the magic she transmits is like a bucket of glitter to anybody who comes into contact with her… Birdie loves life more than anybody I know, and I consider myself fortunate to be her mother!”</p><p>According to Simpson’s Instagram stories, the party included a lot of costly décors, including rainbow balloon arcs created by Balloon and Paper and a golden mannequin decked out in flowers from XO Bloom.</p><p>Jessica Simpson and her family were also spotted standing in front of an amazing Barbie-playhouse-themed cake made by a home baker named Claritza, an Easter Chocolate dessert business, and a Twisted for Sugar cotton candy firm. Simpson’s stories featured Buca di Beppo food, a “Birdie” engraved candy station, a tutu changing station, and an arts and crafts table put together by Little Artist Party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jessica-Simpson-1.jpeg><p>A name-bracelet-making station, a station full of birthday cake-flavored popcorn, and colorful iced drink dispensers at a tutu-decorated beverage counter were among the attractions. Jessica Simpson donned a pink minidress under a hot pink jacket, while daughter Birdie wore a light pink dress with a pink and purple tulle skirt and fairy wings attached to the back.</p><p>Simpson’s oldest daughter was spotted in denim shorts and a white crop top. Ace, her son, was dressed more casually in a black tee, blue shorts, and a hat. Eric Johnson, Simpson’s husband, was dressed in a multi-colored button-down shirt and an orange baseball cap.</p><h2>Jessica Simpson and Eric Johnson have three children together.</h2><p>Jessica Simpson married Eric Johnson, a former football player, in 2014. After being pictured together in Jacksonville, Florida, in July 2010, the pair were initially linked. They apparently began dating in early 2010, when Johnson was still legally married to Keri D’Angelo, a stylist. Johnson proposed to the singer in November 2010 after months of dating, and she answered “yes.”</p><p>In 2012, Simpson and Johnson had their first child, Maxwell Drew Johnson. Drew is Simpson’s mother’s maiden name, whereas Maxwell is Johnson’s middle name and his grandmother’s surname. Ace Knute, the couple’s second child, and only son, were born the following year. Ace receives his middle name after Johnson’s Swedish paternal grandpa, Knute Johnson, in keeping with the family practice of honoring elder relatives.</p><p>Birdie Mae, the couple’s most recent child, was born in 2019. From 2002 until 2006, Jessica Simpson was married to 98 Degrees member Nick Lachey. Both Simpson and Johnson are divorced and have no children from previous marriages.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jessica Simpson And Eric Johnson</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jessica Simpson children</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqujnrCiedKipKmrn6N6orrDZpyroZNit7C0zaymp2WYlsOmedOhqZ6dXZi1qrjDq5ynZaSktKbAx56paA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
