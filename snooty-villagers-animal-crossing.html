According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the game's Fandom</a>, these characters are sometimes referred to as "snobby." They can only be female since the personality types are divided between these two genders, but the male equivalent would be "smug."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Snooty villagers will wear more expensive clothes in the game and care more overall about their appearance. They speak with more of an upper-class maturity and don't always get along with the other villagers. So far, there are 65 Snooty villagers in the Animal Crossing universe.</p><p>Here are all the ones in New Horizons:</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><ul><li>Alli</li><li>Amelia</li><li><a href=#>Ankha</a></li><li>Annalise</li><li>Astrid</li><li>Baabara</li><li>Becky</li><li>Bitty</li><li>Blaire</li><li>Blanche</li><li>Bree</li><li>Broffina</li><li>Cashmere</li><li>Claudia</li><li>Cleo</li><li>Diana</li><li>Elise</li><li>Eloise</li><li>Francine</li><li>Freya</li><li>Friga</li><li>Gigi</li><li>Gloria</li><li>Greta</li><li>Gwen</li><li>Judy</li><li>Julia</li><li>Kitty</li><li>Maelle</li><li>Mallary</li><li>Mathilda</li><li>Mint</li><li>Miranda</li><li>Monique</li><li>Naomi</li><li>Olivia</li><li>Opal</li><li>Pancetti</li><li>Pecan</li><li>Portia</li><li>Purrl</li><li>Queenie</li><li>Robin</li><li>Snooty</li><li>Soleil</li><li>Tasha</li><li>Tiffany</li><li>Timbra</li><li>Tipper</li><li>Velma</li><li>Violet</li><li>Vivian</li><li>Whitney</li><li>Willow</li><li>Yuka</li></ul><p>Here are the snooty villagers from the previous Animal Crossing games:</p><ul><li>Carmen (mouse)</li><li>Cupcake</li><li>Elina</li><li>Jane</li><li>Lulu</li><li>Madam Rosa</li><li>Petunia (Cow)</li><li>Petunia (Rhino)</li><li>Rhoda</li><li>Sue E.</li><li>Tiara</li><li>Valise</li></ul><p>Each personality type also crafts a particular type of DIY that you can collect, which is just one more reason to diversify your island.

Even though others may spawn less often than she does when players look for new characters to live on their island, according to other reports, one thing sets her apart from the rest: She doesn't have an Amiibo card.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In Animal Crossing, Amiibo cards are items bought with real-life money that allow players to bring almost any character they want into their game. Once the character spawns at their campsite, players can then persuade the character to move in. But as of now, Judy doesn't have this option whereas all the other snooty villagers do.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Because of this, players have to hope that they travel on enough mystery islands to run into her by chance, or that she'll come to their campsite on her own. There are also platforms like Nookazon where people can list their Judys up for sale for in-game currency, and there are even some people who sell Animal Crossing characters for real-life money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLuwu9OyZK%2BhnKGuqLHRrGSappmirq15wqumrKuZo7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
