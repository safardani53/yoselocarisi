Not by the heedless fire starter but by each of the 1000’s of people who torched the problem with their own two taps on WhatsApp.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Whether the content started its journey as an incomprehensibly foolish endorsement or malicious attack, fortunately, the result remained the same.</p><h4>Yes. They are nudes.</h4><h4>No. We don’t really care.</h4><p>The lack of comment from Zara’s parents highlight the most logical and humane reaction to the issue – whatever, move on.</p><p>It’s the practice that the U.K proudly put into action, with little response to the nudes on social media and a ‘we’re bored of this sort of sh*t’ attitude down the pub.</p><p>However, there are always a few cretins hiding away on Twitter. Those who couldn’t get their heads around the concept of sending revealing and sexual photos.</p><p>Whether sent in lust, in love, in attempts to reap attention or to simply prove a little self-worth, apparently, sending nudes is an alien concept that none of us have ever contemplated.</p><h4>Take your head out of your a*se, Twitter.</h4><h4>And film it on webcam next time.</h4><p>During this week’s mass of Love Island episodes, Zara gave some untimely advice to Rosie Williams and Megan Barton-Hanson, telling them to be careful when it came to their raunchy villa model shoot.</p><p>Zara quipped: “I would never get naked like that in front of people”. Suddenly, sections of Twitter felt that they had accumulated some sort of moral high ground.</p><p>Click, click, 240 characters – “what an idiot, she doesn’t even know that her nudes are going around online haha”.</p><p>Click, click, 0.2 seconds – “you seen these photos of Zara from Love Island?”</p><h4>These are the same two people.</h4><h4>People the world could do without.</h4><p>We hope that the producers maintain the same resolute mentality as Zara’s parents and the U.K public, refraining from the need to tell her about the cruelness of the outside world.</p><p>After all, content circulates for seven days. The tabloid media squeezes traffic from the story by hinting that they have footage. All is forgotten.</p><p>If Zara’s nudes and Zara’s ‘revenge porn’ was initially dished out in attempts to sabotage her Love Island career and to ruin her image on national television.</p><p>Well.</p><p>We all know who the real loser is, here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfpL2qusiopWinoJ67qrvNZrGaqpFiuqSwxKukqKykYru2sMSsZJ2nXayybq3CrayapJyueqSt0Z4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
