I like how he is lamenting his previous life, and our Louis is very much the same. But I’d say our Louis packs a little more punch. I believe he is more likely to attack Lestat. He’s a little less moody at first, but we get there! We get there, but I think he’s got a little more bite.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jacob-Anderson-2.jpg alt="Jacob Anderson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Anderson’s character is shown chatting to reporter Daniel Molloy about Lestat de Lioncourt in the Interview With the Vampire trailer, saying, “He is my killer, my mentor, my lover, and my creator.”</p><h2>More details about Interview With the Vampire</h2><p>Interview With the Vampire follows vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac as he tells a reporter about his existence.
