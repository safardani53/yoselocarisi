The brunette beauty rocked an oversized bright-orange sweater with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baggy jeans</a>. Taylor accessorized her cozy Sunday ensemble with black sunglasses, gold hoops, and tied her tresses up and back into an elegant ponytail.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Later, a fan spotted the duo riding bicycles together around the same area. In <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a video</a>, Harry was pictured waving at the fan as he and Taylor zoomed by on bright green bikes. Many of their fans took to the comments section of the clip to react to their romantic outing. “He’s introduced her to the lime bikes, they have to get married now,” one admirer joked, while another added, “they’re such cuties.” A separate fan couldn’t help but think that the fan account meant his ex-girlfriend, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, who he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dated briefly</a> in 2012. “Omg tell me why when I read Taylor I thought about TS,” they penned.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>This isn’t the first time that the new couple has been spotted together in recent months, as Harry and Taylor were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pictured getting cozy</a> at an event on August 10. Harry attended the press event for Taylor’s new play The Effect, in which she stars. In photos obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> last month, the&nbsp;<strong>One Direction&nbsp;</strong>alum wrapped his arms around his leading lady.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Harry’s recent romance with the Canada native comes nearly one year after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he split</a> from&nbsp;Don’t Worry Darling&nbsp;director&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></a>. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>39-year-old beauty and Harry</a> dated for nearly two years until they decided to call it quits in November 2022. Multiple sources told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>at the time that the now-exes were “taking a break.” Their split also came amid Olivia’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>custody battle</a> with her ex,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong></a>. “He’s&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>still touring</a> and is now going abroad,” one of the insiders told the mag last year. “She is focusing on her kids and her work in L.A. It’s a very amicable decision.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5FvZqGZoqfGbr%2FTsqOeq12Wu6V505qwpaeiYr%2B2v9Keo6VlmKS5pXnHmqWdq12Wu6V50aKbnmWSnrimv4yipWakn6OxsLqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
