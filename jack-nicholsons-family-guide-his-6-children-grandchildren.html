After the couple welcomed their daughter, <strong>Jennifer Nicholson</strong>, in 1963, they remained married for five more years.</p><p>Once their divorce was finalized in 1968, <a href=#>the Departed actor</a> allegedly had a fling with his Five Easy Pieces costar <a href=#>Susan Anspach</a> that resulted in the birth of his second child, <strong>Caleb Goddard</strong>. Jack, however, has yet to publicly acknowledge the paternity.</p><p>The <a href=#>Something’s Gotta Give</a> star moved on with Danish supermodel and actress <strong>Winnie Hollman</strong>, whom he dated for five years. The pair welcomed daughter <a href=#><strong>Honey Hollman</strong></a> in 1982.</p><p>Jack’s relationship with American actress <strong>Rebecca Broussard</strong> is one of his more public romances. The twosome had an affair during his 17-year relationship with <a href=#><strong>Anjelica Huston</strong></a>, which led to the arrival of their first child, daughter <a href=#><strong>Lorraine Nicholson</strong></a>, in 1990.</p><p>Two years later, the One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest actor welcomed son <a href=#><strong>Ray Nicholson</strong></a> with Broussard. The duo called it quits in 1993. “We have a relationship,” Jack told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> in April 1994 of Broussard. “Because of the children, but we have no other relationship.”</p><p>In 2011, the Anger Management star gave fans a rare glimpse at his dynamic with Lorraine and Ray. “They’re great. I was never what you call a hands-on sort of father, but I’m lucky my kids have turned out the way they have,” Jack said at the time via the<a href=#> Daily Mail</a>. “Parenthood is all about being in the lap of the gods. All you can do is your best.”</p><p>Lorraine, who is one of Jack’s many children to dabble in acting, teased her dynamic with her famous father three years later.</p><p>“He gives me top secret advice,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in February 2014. “Obviously, I’m not going to share it with anyone, because it gives our family a competitive advantage.”</p><p>Jack’s sixth child, however, claimed she never received the same guidance and support. <strong>Tessa Gourin</strong>, who was born to waitress <strong>Jennine Gourin</strong>, in 1994, alleged in early 2023 that she never knew her dad growing up. While she claimed that Jack is her biological father, the actor has never publicly commented on the paternity.</p><p>Tessa claimed in a February 2023 interview with <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a> that the As Good As It Gets actor “wasn’t interested’ in having a relationship with her as a child. She did, however, explain that Jack was involved in the funding of her early education.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I knew he was powerful and Daddy Warbucks-level rich, so I kind of equated my life to being like Orphan Annie’s,” she told the outlet, revealing that her mother told her “not to tell anyone that I have this famous dad.”</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Jack’s blended family:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6KvymalopuYpLm0u82sZJ%2BZnZ65unnGrqCdnV2dtrR5lWaaoaGcmb%2BmuoygqZqmlJi1qrjDq5ynZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
