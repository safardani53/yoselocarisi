She accessorized with only a pair of silver V-shaped earrings to complete the look, with her hair styled in beachy waves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harlow, whose real name is Chantelle Whitney Brown-Young, admitted to PEOPLE in 2021 that there was a time when she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>doubted if she could make it in the modeling industry</a>, but said she persevered to build a career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Winnie Harlow in Women's Health May/June 2023.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Daniella Midenge for Women’s Health</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My younger self always believed in the power of faith, strength, and perseverance, while learning vulnerability and being authentically myself," she expanded to Women's Health. "I got a lot of no's along the way, but I just pushed through."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To achieve my goals with the world watching has been scary at times, but all in all, the ultimate blessing," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The CAY Skin founder told Women's Health that now that she's in front of the camera, she wants to be an "inspiration" to others with the disease. She recalled one fan who came up to her and told her that their mother also had vitiligo and had tried to cover her arms out of embarrassment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They said, 'My whole life, my mother never felt beautiful, and then I showed her a picture of you and now she wears short sleeves,'" Harlow told the publication. "It's beautiful that I can help inspire confidence in people, no matter what walk of life they are from."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Winnie Harlow in Women's Health May/June 2023.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Daniella Midenge for Women’s Health</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with inspiring people to become more comfortable in their own skin, she also told the publication that she is passionate about sun care and her brand CAY Skin, after getting sunburned so badly during a Bahamas photo shoot that her vitiligo was altered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was shooting from sunup to sundown on the beach," she told the publication, adding that she'd been discouraged from reapplying sunscreen during the shoot due to its white cast. "Obviously, shooting on the beach without sunscreen is insane, but I did it to get good shots."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harlow said sunscreen is now a must for her, along with focusing on strength training to keep her body strong. She noted that she wants people to define their own beauty, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want to show the world that beauty is whatever we each want it to be," Harlow said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjrCgp6aZmnqprdGlprBloKTApr%2BMp6ydnV2ku27Dzqacp6tdnbKiuNOhZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
