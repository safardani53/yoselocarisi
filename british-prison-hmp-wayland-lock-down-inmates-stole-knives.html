It's bad enough not spotting one knife left unattended but three?</p><p>“Those knives are used to cut through thick Lino flooring and the way the blades are curved means they could do a lot of damage.”</p><p>They added the security will be “ramped up” after the staff were “astonishingly negligent”.</p><p>A Prison Service spokesperson said: “These items were quickly recovered and prisoners engaging in this kind of behaviour can expect punishment.</p><p>“The prison will be reminding its contractors of the importance of securing their equipment.”</p><h2>'DISTURBING' PRISON FIGURES</h2><p>The lockdown happened on the same day that government figures showed violence and self-harm in prisons are “unacceptably high”.</p><p>The figures show that in the year to September, there were 33,803 assault incidents, up 20 per cent from the previously 12 months.</p><p>There were 52,814 self-harm incidents, which is a 23 per cent increase and a new record high, according to the Ministry of Justice’s report.</p><p>Justice Minister David Gauke acknowledged the latest figures were “disturbing”.</p><p>He said: “Violence and self-harm in our prisons is unacceptably high and these figures underline why we are spending an extra £70m to fight the drugs plaguing prisons and boost security, while also training over 4,000 new prison officers in handling the complex offender population.</p><p>Clearly there is a huge amount yet to be done but I am determined to cut the violence so prisons can focus on rehabilitating the offenders who will be back out at some point.”</p><p>HMP Wayland, near Thetford, is a Category C prison.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>It is where Reggie Kray was held before his release in 2000 and the Westminster Bridge terrorist Khalid Masood spent two years there.</p><p>The prison has a history of violence and saw four deaths in custody in 2015.</p><p>Paul Cawkwell, the prison governor, was severely beaten by an inmate in the canteen in August 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000462196669.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000448165379.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000256874612.jpg><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
