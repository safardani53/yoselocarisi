I will never be off the hook and I am fully accountable for my harmful behavior, and will be for my actions moving forward.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"In my effort to be a better man, I have fought to get sober, but this time I'm doing it with professional help. Sobriety is a priority in my life, and so is my mental health. These, as I'm learning, go hand in hand.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"But I will not bore anyone with stories of my demons or use them to excuse what I've done. I really want to express that I've internalized the importance of self-care and self-work.
