During our testing, we found these to be durable and supportive without being restrictive or suffocating. With a 7/8 length, these hit just below the ankle on someone who is 5-foot-2, so keep in mind if you're shorter or taller than average. Thanks to the thick material, they also passed our squat test, so we're happy to report these leggings are gym-friendly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Constructed from a four-way stretch fabric with sweat-wicking and odor-resistant features, these comfortable leggings allow you to get your flow on while helping to maintain dryness, despite the heat. They also come in lots of fun colors, including classics like black and white and a beautiful dark plum, midnight green, and bright red. Worth noting: These weren't as great for HIIT workouts or running since the waistband tended to slip down a bit during these types of exercises. They also don't have pockets, so if that's important to you, keep scrolling for other options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex | <strong>Size Range: </strong>XXS-XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, white, cantaloupe, blue splash, red hot summer, oatmeal heather, lemonade, chalk blue, French vanilla, dark plum, green glow, midnight green</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-leggings-depot-high-waisted-solid-yoga-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Leggings Depot High Waisted Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Leggings Depot High Waisted Leggings for Women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kHOkOfHlVwvnZK6lwu86oVgmr5A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/leggings-depot-high-waisted-leggings-for-women-buttery-soft-3-waistband-womens-leggings-solid-yoga---reg-plus-1x3x-3x5x-2f848925f93747acadf3b5cdbabb22b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Amazon is overflowing with some fantastic legging picks, however, the Leggings Depot High Waisted Leggings for Women is considered the best. These leggings are ideal everyday basics, thanks to their simple design, comfortable high-waist fit, super soft fabric, and stretch. Plus, the color options and sizing bring a wow factor like no other with sizes up to 5XL offered, along with 45 colors. While we don't recommend them for hardcore workouts or gym squats, if you need a comfy option to wear with sweaters to the office or for low-impact workouts and stretching on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>yoga mat</a>, you can’t go wrong with this budget buy from Amazon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>92% polyester, 8% spandex | <strong>Size Range: </strong>S-5XL (plus One Size and One Size Plus) | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, burgundy, charcoal gray, heather gray, and 40 others</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-campsnail-4-pack-high-waisted-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Value</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Campsnail 4-Pack High Waisted Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Prime Day CAMPSNAIL 4 Pack High Waisted Leggings for Women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/9x-HGCcvzM8g5seNS8MWYN4ypiM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/campsnail-4-pack-high-waisted-leggings-for-women--soft-tummy-control-slimming-yoga-pants-for-workout-running-reg--plus-size-41593ea10ae54f68b2a934493a3822c6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Budget-friendly and high-quality, this four-pack of leggings for $30 from Amazon is a total steal. The Campsnail High-Waisted Leggings set comes in 14 different color palettes and styles, including a pack of black, pink, blue, and green (as well as an all-black fleece-lined option) and is constructed from polyester with 8 percent stretch for maximum comfort and flexibility. Designed with durability in mind, these leggings are incredibly versatile and work well for everyday wear as well as high-intensity workouts, yoga, and running. They don't come in a wide range of sizes, so they may not be ideal for someone who prefers more individualized sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>92% polyester, 8% spandex | <strong>Size Range: </strong>S-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, pink, blue, green, navy, gray, wine, dark gray, army green, camo, black leopard, gray slate, dim gray, white, coffee</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-size-options-athleta-salutation-stash-tight></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Size Options</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Salutation Stash Tight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Salutation Stash Tight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/i4SSEm8EDNVtbHzUs8IetOfhWJs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/athleta-salutation-stash-tight-6d6d4a05a57d463c81785090f0edd40b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designed for athleisure and movement alike, the Athleta Salutation Stash Tight has a buttery soft feel that can move with you on your mat but also looks cute with a sweater and sneakers for a comfortable everyday look. They also feature one of the best size spectrums on our list with sizes XXS-3XL in regular, XS-XL in tall, and XXS-L in petite. With a range of excellent color options, including neutrals like black and tan, as well as bright red, green, orange, and a gorgeous burgundy brown, you're sure to find exactly what you need. They're more functional than stylish, so they may not be the right pick for someone looking for a more fashion-forward legging style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, lycra | <strong>Size Range: </strong>XXS-3XL (regular), XS-XL (tall), XXS-L (petite) | <strong>Colors: </strong>Rustic beige, spiced cabernet, seaweed snack, navy, black, candy red, foliage orange</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fleece-lined-baleaf-womens-fleece-lined-winter-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Fleece-Lined</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Baleaf Fleece-Lined Winter Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=" BALEAF Women's Fleece Lined Winter Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/9h1Mz5qixgtze1XUfgk2NVKJ2VI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/baleaf-womens-fleece-lined-winter-leggings-high-waisted-thermal-warm-yoga-pants-with-pockets-3c6cf9b7e57242bb84a70882026e63bd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re on the hunt for a pair of leggings that will keep you warm and toasty during the frigid winter months, the Baleaf fleece-lined leggings are our top pick for the best fleece-lined leggings. These leggings have rave reviews for their well-made construction, warm and comfortable design, and fit. Plus, they come in three different styles — water resistant, without pockets, and with pockets — so you can choose a style that best fits your needs. The fleece leggings are made from a durable polyester fabric with 13 percent spandex stretch — so, despite their warmth, they can still move with you. With that said, they’re ideal for everyday wear and might be a little too thick for workouts as they aren’t as breathable as more sweat-wicking styles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>82% polyester, 18% spandex | <strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-3XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, army green, dark blue, gray, purple, wine, niagara, white, blue ice, brown</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-training-lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight-with-pockets></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Training</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lululemon Wunder Train High-rise Tight with Pockets</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight with Pockets" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VypzntORkZ4K657UWYViwWwgLmQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight-with-pockets-e4fb737b5a5845228ea2b4e566a16816.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lululemon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight with Pockets is known to be great for training, and our tests confirmed this. They are designed to withstand ultra-sweaty workouts with the brand’s fastest-drying fabric. On top of that, they are durable, supportive, and have a flexible four-way stretch, with a drawstring waist that helps keep them secure. Despite all the movement, these leggings kept their shape after multiple wears and washes, thanks to the addition of lycra fiber, which allows them to stretch without losing their structure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The leggings also come in a variety of vibrant and neutral colors, including classic black, pomegranate red, roasted brown, and cayenne orange, and they have pockets so you can keep your phone and keys close as needed. One thing worth mentioning is that while sweat-wicking, they aren't super breathable, so if you need a more lightweight pair of leggings for hot yoga or if you live in a hot climate, these may be too thick for your liking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, lycra, elastane | <strong>Size Range: </strong>0-20 | <strong>Colors: </strong>Java, blue nile, roasted brown, pomegranate, cayenne, heather graphite grey, black</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maternity-girlfriend-collective-black-seamless-maternity-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Maternity</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective Seamless Maternity Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Girlfriend Collective Black Seamless Maternity Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/nnKIR7Tu_PIrb_apQjmG83XOhrg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/girlfriend-collective-black-seamless-maternity-legging-85316259be454f568eed274c8d9bb9dc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Girlfriend Collective</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best workout legging for moms-to-be is the Girlfriend Collective Seamless Maternity Legging. Much like other Girlfriend Collective leggings, these are constructed from eco-friendly fabric consisting of recycled nylon (derived from fishing nets in the ocean) and spandex. They’re designed with a foldable over-the-belly rise, have a second skin feel, and four-way stretch, allowing you to move comfortably in your workouts without worrying about restrictions. While they may not be the first pick of someone looking for a more fashion-forward legging, they’re ideal for sweaty workouts with their moisture-wicking and breathable design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>83% recycled nylon, 17% spandex | <strong>Size Range: </strong>XXS-6XL (in two inseam lengths) | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, midnight, moss, plum, smoke</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-faux-leather-spanx-faux-leather-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Faux Leather</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Faux Leather Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Faux Leather Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YYnwZLvXqh0bL_QJjKBtmHgtjpg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-faux-leather-leggings-18d5541910754f2889d7cd28309d88c3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leather pants are cute but not always the most comfortable. For a pair of leather pants that moves with you without restrictions, we recommend the faux leather leggings from Spanx. PEOPLE Commerce Writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison Yauger</a> says she loves these leggings because "they're so sleek and can make any outfit a little more elevated."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These beloved leggings are also a favorite amongst influencers like Dani Austin and celebrities from Kelly Clarkson to Hailee Steinfeld. We loved that they come in an inclusive size range — with regular, petite, and tall options — so you can trust that they will hug you in all the right places. And because they are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Spanx leggings</a>, they also come with a side of shapewear, featuring a shaping waistband, a contoured design for shaping the booty, and built-in camel-toe prevention (which we very much appreciated).

These leggings are made from a super comfy and stretchy ribbed cotton jersey material with 5 percent spandex stretch for a glove-like fit. They’re breathable, stylish, and have a boxer-like look that is Kardashian-approved. On top of that, they come in lots of amazing colors, including a range of skin tones, and neutrals like gray, white, and black, as well as bright red and cobalt blue. Like many of our favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SKIMS products</a>, they're also available in a wide range of sizes, from XXS to 4X.

The Airbrush High-Waist Bootcut Legging has the perfect silhouette with a hem that reaches just beyond the ankle for a stylish fit. And much like the beloved <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Alo Yoga 7/8 High-Waist Airbrush Legging</a>, these are constructed from an ultra stretchy polyester and spandex material that boasts lots of breathability while wicking away sweat to keep you nice and dry during your workouts.

The Superior Phone Pocket Ankle Biter Leggings come in seven sizes and are made with a comfortable, supportive high-rise waist. They feature a large side pocket that sits seamlessly against the leg when not in use but is still big enough to hold your smartphone, keys, and AirPods, too. Constructed from polyester with 29 percent elastane, the leggings are out-of-this-world stretchy, making them ideal for almost every kind of workout, especially pilates and yoga. They have a fun logo design on the sides of the waist for added detail and flair, but that might not be for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>71% polyester, 29% elastane | <strong>Size Range: </strong>XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, sunset orange</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shapewear-spanx-booty-boost-active-78-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Shapewear</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Booty Boost Active 7/8 Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Booty Boost Active 7/8 Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4ukNdsoE1O8SaQY_nVrcfD8rLZQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-booty-boost-active-78-leggings-0967682d2737431b98c3929cf6843623.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>These leggings are a great choice for anyone seeking a pair of quick-dry, sweat-wicking, breathable leggings.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best shapewear leggings are undoubtedly the Spanx Booty Boost Active 7/8 Leggings, which are designed for an active lifestyle while providing just the right amount of life, support, and shape. While they may not be ideal for those who prefer a dressier pair of leggings, these are constructed from the brand’s unique sculpting performance fabric and feature a contoured waistline to help lift the booty and keep the waist feeling secure. In addition to its shapewear features, the leggings are also quick-dry, sweat-wicking, and breathable with four-way stretch so they can withstand high-intensity workouts, too.

For the best pair of leggings in this style, consider the Athleta Elation Split Flare Pant, which features a flared hem silhouette with a slit up the front of the ankles. We love these because they are designed to reach just beyond the ankles (so they don’t drag on the floor) and have a slit size that is just big enough to expose our favorite chunky sneakers. Additionally, the leggings have a comfortable high-waist fit with a sweat-wicking lycra and nylon material that helps evaporate moisture during challenging workouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon and lycra | <strong>Size Range: </strong>XXS-3XL (regular, petite, tall) | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, ancient mahogany, noble blue</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-going-out-good-american-vinyl-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Going Out</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Vinyl Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Vinyl Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/zq_qNgg45A-CN9OTf7b1YvS7nLk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Good-American-Vinyl-Leggings-de03e1b346044c63920230c0759f468e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best leggings for going out are the Good American Vinyl Leggings, which feature a glossy patent leather-like finish. These faux leather leggings are ultra shiny and slick and come in an inclusive size range of XS through 5X.

Our top pick for the best-ribbed leggings is the Year of Ours Ribbed Football Legging, which we live in. These leggings are inspired by retro football pants (hence the name) and feature a minimalistic ribbed detail with a comfortable lace-up waistline that allows for a more custom fit. Constructed from nylon and spandex, the leggings are ideal for sweaty workouts with their breathable and moisture-wicking technology, plus they boast lots of style, making them dreamy for athleisure days, too.

When considering size, it helps to take note of any insights from product reviews to find out whether or not a legging is true to size, as well as the product description for insight from the brand. If you are unsure of your size, consider taking your measurements and reviewing the brand’s size chart, which will help guide you to the right legging for women for your specific body.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Color and Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Next, Elizabeth says to consider color, which can vary from person to person and is very much dependent on personal style preferences and wardrobe needs. “I would first invest in colors that are universal for your wardrobe,” she explains. “Blacks and tans always seem to roll from season to season and typically blend well into a closet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to color, Elizabeth also says to look at the style of the leggings and choose options based on your needs and preferences. Many leggings for women come in high-waist silhouettes, but you can also find mid-rise options, too. Additionally, leggings fit snugly around the ankle as well as flare out like a pair of statement-making jeans. When shopping for leggings for women, Elizabeth says a three-quarter legging style can be worn with both sneakers or heels. She also recommends starting with a high-waist style.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Quality and Durability<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Quality is also important as you need pieces to hold up for as many workouts and washes as possible,” says Wahler. A quality legging can be marked in a variety of ways. “Depending on the fabric, you want to make sure that they are not see-through and, if necessary, they come above your stomach and hold you in or at the minimum sit above your hip bones,” says Elizabeth. She also adds that thicker compression fabrics can smooth out the look of the legs and tend to indicate a higher quality, too. With this in mind, consider the material type, how much stretch a legging has, and any insight on the overall performance, shape retention, and technology used to create the leggings. Most high-quality leggings for women will have transparent product pages with this information so you can easily research the best leggings for you and your activity needs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-124be451-92fd-4159-931e-afc23dcf400c></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=44.719827586207><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.92217898832685><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the best quality leggings for women?</span></p><p>All the leggings for women on our list of top picks are considered high-quality for their price point and performance capabilities.
