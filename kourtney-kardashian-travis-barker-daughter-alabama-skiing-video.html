The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star shared some pics and a video to Instagram on Apr. 11 and they showed her wearing a neon green snowsuit while having a great time with the teen, who was wearing her own neon orange snowsuit, during their recent ski trip. In the clip, Kourtney could be seen bending down as low as she could as she slowly skied under a space left from Alabama standing with her legs stretched out far apart.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In addition to the hilarious moment between her and Alabama, who Travis shares with ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shanna Moakler</strong></a>, 46, Kourtney shared pics of her youngest son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reign</strong></a>, 6, whom she shares with ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>, 37, hugging her on the slopes while wearing a red, blue, and black snowsuit.

It was full of pics of her and Reign <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>happily posing</a> in different ski suits and knit caps while standing on the snow. There was also a video of them roasting marshmallows over a fire and a snapshot that showed off a delicious-looking cup of hot chocolate.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kourtney‚Äôs beau Travis, who was also on the trip, shared a video of his own on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>snowy</a> slopes on his Instagram. In it, he was snowboarding in a neon orange jacket and black ski pants. He kept a steady pace as he glided down the snowy hill and looked great. ‚ÄúAnd FIRST TIME ü•∂üî•,‚Äù Kourtney responded in the comments section of the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH11e5BqZqSnpafBr7HYZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdkraqRq7a0ecGaqaSdomKxosHGoaueql2WuaKuwKaYZqubnravs4yvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
