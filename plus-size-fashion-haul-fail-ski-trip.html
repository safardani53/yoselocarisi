No. Am I organised? No. Do I even have a ski suit. Haha, no.</p><p>"I hate my brain. Ugh. So let's pray this fits because we're packing and I need to be at the airport in 12 hours."</p><p>But her try on clip started badly and only got worse as base layer leggings and tops proved too small in three separate colours.</p><p>"Now I know this is very unflattering. Sorry. Very, very unflattering.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>"PLT, why does your ski collection only go up to an XL? Where's the double XL?</p><p>"Are fat people not allowed to ski? Because I'm going skiing and this is tight and it's very stretched. It is very see through."</p><p>But she added: "I've left everything last minute, so it's just gonna have to do.</p><p>"The XL leggings are fine. The bodysuit is like cutting me in half, but it'll do for a base layer.</p><p>"I just feel like the size up would have just been perfect.</p><p>"I just wish they done a double XL.</p><p>"I would have really appreciated that. Actually, I would have really, really loved that."</p><p>And after joking that a £33 black unitard made her look like a spy, Rachel's zip popped on her bust leaving her exposing more than she bargained for.</p><p>She said: "I think this one can go back.</p><p>"Very tight, very uncomfortable. I just don't get why it stops at an XL.</p><p>"It's very, very annoying. Very frustrating."</p><p>Social media users were loving Rachel's disastrous try on, with the clip racking up more than 227,000 views.</p><p>And it's one specific moment that had them laughing so hard that they spat out their drinks.</p><p>"Crying at the zip having a mind of its own", one said.</p><p>A second added: "Omg not the zip literally flying down."</p><p>A third echoed: "I’m creasing at the zip flying down."</p><p>Meanwhile a fourth wrote: "I’m so sorry but I spat out my drink laughing when the zip flew open."</p><p>It comes after Rachel recently&nbsp;<a href=#>felt like she looked like "a stuffed sausage in the oven"</a>&nbsp;after a last-minute PLT order.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She was looking for the perfect outfit for a winter break with her pals but felt like a silver two-piece made her resemble an "alien".</p><p>Trying on the outfit, Rachel said: "Oh my God, what was I thinking?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FuZ2xrYG2CcLzLrqpmq5mvsm6ywKyfoqeeYrWiwctmnZqhnGLArLWMramiqF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
