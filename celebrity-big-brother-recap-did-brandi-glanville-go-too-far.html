It was the first time we have ever witnessed an expression on Brandi Glanville’s face.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ross-matthews-shannon-elizabeth-1024x686.png><p>She was annoyed because this was supposed to be the time to send Shannon Elizabeth out in a backdoor eviction. Brandi ran her mouth like she was still on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, before ultimately making peace with the decision.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the HOH competition got underway, Brandi chatted about the way she spoke to Keshia and said she knew that they would be friends when they reunited on the outside.&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, you keep telling yourself that, Brandi. This is a game, and it should not be made personal. Brandi has been catty all season long and has wanted to get Shannon out for no apparent reason.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/brandi-cleavage-681x1024.jpg><p>Shannon seemed confused about why Keshia was trying to blow her game up during her eviction speech. Those who thought Shannon Elizabeth was a great player should probably exit stage left.&nbsp;</p><p>During the HOH competition, Shannon took an early lead, and everyone aside from James looked annoyed. As soon as Ariadna emerged victoriously from the competition, everyone was a little too excited for her.&nbsp;</p><p>That did not do much to make Shannon’s paranoia disappear. She knew there was some backstab in the works, and that’s why she tried to speak to her supposed allies about what was coming.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/shannon-elizabeth-poses-683x1024.jpg><p>However, her allies made sure Ariadna was never alone without either Omarosa or Metta, and that made it difficult for Shannon to get an answer.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the nominations ceremony, the penny dropped for Shannon that she would never find a role as big as the one she had in American Pie. We’re totally kidding about that last part.&nbsp;</p><p>Shannon figured it all out and said some words right before Ariadna confirmed who was on the block. Brandi countered that Shannon was cutting deals with the others.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ariadna-gutierrez-poses-683x1024.jpg><p>Shannon balked at this idea and was subsequently put on the block next to James. It looks like Shannon’s time in the Big Brother house is coming to a dramatic close!</p><p>In any case, it looks like the producers are trying to give Shannon another chance. The reason? A game-changing vote is coming our way in the next few days.&nbsp;</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if it affected the next eviction? What if the viewers could vote instead of the house?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/shannon-elizabeth-smiles-723x1024.jpg><p>That would shake things up and give Shannon a fighting chance.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think about all of this?</p><p>Hit the comments below.&nbsp;</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Big Brother Winners: RANKED!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2V%2FcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm6uyKBkm6qfqbWmvoyrnJyZoGKxqrCMm6mappSeeqi4wKetoqScmnqou4ytpqhllpa%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
