The <a href=#>Brazilian</a> side from this era are rightly lauded for the attacking swagger and talent on show, and Santos was a new breed of right-back.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000394955213.jpg><p><span><strong>Best moment:</strong> A stunning performance in the 1958 final, which got him into the All-star team for the tournament. Not bad, considering it was the <strong>ONLY</strong> game Santos played. With <a href=#>Garrincha</a> pulling the strings in attack, the hosts were torn apart 5-2.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>Any controversy?</strong> Seen as he shared a wing with one of the most controversial and bonkers players of all time, Santos was the complete opposite. An exemplary professional, in his 1,000+ games he was never sent off.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>Pub quiz stat:</strong> There are only three players who have been named in three World Cup All-star teams - Santos, <a href=#>Phillip Lahm</a> and <a href=#>Franz Beckenbauer</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Carlos Alberto - Brazil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000277485584.jpg><p><strong>DESPITE a 38-year-old Santos going to England 1966, there was a new kid on the block to take over the reigns.</strong></p><p>Carlos Alberto built on the attacking foundations laid by Santos and turned them up a notch, starring in the stunning Brazil team of 1970.</p><p>Despite an injury-hit spell in the mid-70s, he'll always be remembered for his part in the triumph in Mexico and his goal in the Final.</p><p><span><strong>World Cup record:</strong> One appearance, one win - but only through bad luck. He was named in the provisional squad for 1966, but didn't make the finals where Brazil bombed out in the quarters. Four years later he was as key to the side as anyone as Brazil lifted the World Cup, before injury stopped him appearing at any games in <a href=#>Germany</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000277487165.jpg><p><span><strong>Best moment:</strong> What else? His wonder-goal against Italy in the 1970 World Cup final. After almost telepathic teamwork and individual flair in a slick move from front-to-back, Jairzinho pulled Giacinto Facchetti out of position and fed <a href=#>Pele</a>. The great man laid it into the path of the onrushing Carlos Alberto and the right-back hit a crashing strike into the far corner from 18 yards. Words don't do it justice.&nbsp;</span></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Brazilian soccer great and World Cup hero Carlos Alberto Super Goal</span><p><span><strong>Questionable hair:</strong> In spades. Anyone who can pull off the mutton-chops and afro combination and still look half-decent deserves endless credit.</span></p><p><strong>He said what? </strong>As manager of Azerbaijan, Carlos didn't take well to <a href=#>Michael Owen</a> suggesting he'd net five against his team: "Where are those five goals tonight? I have a history in football but what is the history of this guy, this midget? He ought to clean his tongue and wash the boots of David Beckham as they are so wet tonight." Blimey.</p><h2>Franz Beckenbauer - West Germany</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000090505673.jpg><p><strong>WE'VE finally made it to Der Kaiser.</strong></p><p>One of the most elegant, dominant and iconic players in history - and a right bloomin' nuisance for <a href=#>England</a> fans over the years.</p><p>Known for perfecting the art of the modern sweeper (or libero if you're feeling posh), Beckenbauer finished his international career in 1977 after 103 caps and 14 goals after perfecting the balance between attack and defence.</p><p><span><strong>World Cup record:</strong> Runners-up in 1966, third-place in 1970 and winners in 1974. Beckenbauer was instrumental in all three tournaments, but his finest hour was on home soil in '74. Firm favourites for the title, his side delivered under huge pressure thanks to his leadership from the back.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000377566750.jpg><p><span><strong>Best moment:</strong> Dominating the Dutch in the final of 1974. Johan Cruyff and Co's 'Total Football' was snuffed out by a masterclass from the German defence. Four years earlier in the 'Game of the Century' with Italy, Beckenbauer played on with a dislocated shoulder as the Germans had run out of subs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>What happened next?</strong> He only went and won the World Cup as a manager, leading Germany to the 1990 World Cup. His football might have been mind-numbingly dreary, but boy was it effective.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>Quote me:</strong> Kevin Keegan here, talking real sense: "He's a gentleman, a perfect Englishman. Unfortunately, he's not English".&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Patrick Vieira - France</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000003813560.jpg><p><strong>THE France team of the late 90s and early 00s were chocked full of stars - but it was the sum of their parts that made them great.</strong></p><p>You could probably pick players faster, more skilful than <a href=#>Patrick Vieira</a>, yet you'd struggle to name anyone who slotted into that No4 role quite as well as the former <a href=#>Arsenal</a> man.</p><p>Hard as nails and the enforcer infront of the back-four, Viera made 107 appearances for Les Bleus, scoring six times.</p><p><span><strong>World Cup record:</strong> One win in 1998, a disaster in 2002 and a near-miss in 2006. Vieira was the driving force behind the run to the final in Germany after he gave the captaincy back to the returning <a href=#>Zinedine Zidane</a> prior to the tournament.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000001446686.jpg><p><span><strong>Best moment:</strong> Not the 1998 final as you'd expect, where Vieira came off the bench to set up Emmanuel Petit for the third. Instead it's his performance in 2006, where he put together a run of great performances just behind a rejuvenated Zidane. His goal in the 3-1 win over Spain typified his tournament, pouncing at the far post and powering a header past <a href=#>Iker Casillas</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>Quote me:</strong>&nbsp;How about this one from David Dein: "I talked to Patrick in fluent French and before a game I asked in French, ‘could you speak a little bit of English to me?’. He nodded and said ‘Tottenham are s**t'".&nbsp;</span></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Brazilian football legend Pele reveals his shock at World Cup selection aged just 17</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2t%2Fc4WPcW1om5%2Bqu7WwzrClZqyfYr%2B2v9KimGamn2nAbrLRmqWzZZKasKyxzZuYrp2iYrCivsuoqmaZnJeys8DOZpujmZyirm6%2FwKerqKtdpa61vsicomaumZq2s62O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
