The 17-year-old actress is staring in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ava Duvernay</strong></a>‘s new show&nbsp;Naomi, which is based on the comic book series co-written by <strong>Brian Michael Bendis</strong> and <strong>David F. Walker</strong>. The show follows comic book-loving teenager Naomi (Kaci), who explores her hidden destiny after a supernatural event shakes her small hometown of Port Oswego.&nbsp;Yes, that means Naomi becomes a superhero! The show premieres on The CW on January 11.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>So who is Kaci Walfall? Below,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>has rounded up five key things to know about the up-and-coming actress who is bringing another epic superhero to life on the small screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kaci-Walfall-5-Things-Naomi-The-CW-embed-1.jpg><h2><strong><i>Kaci started acting in 2013.</i></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kaci’s very first acting gig was as Nyah in Lifetime’s&nbsp;Army Wives, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb page</a>. She appeared in six episodes in 2013. Kaci then appeared on the TV shows&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Person of Interest</a>,&nbsp;Power,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Equalizer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Modern Love</a>. Now, Kaci gets to take on the superhero genre in her role on&nbsp;Naomi.</p><h2><strong><i>Ava DuVernay picked Kaci to star in ‘Naomi’.</i></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kaci had to audition for&nbsp;Naomi. After she met creator Ava Duvernay (<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>When The See Us</a>) for a Zoom call, the pair went out to lunch together. “We sat down at this vegan restaurant, and we talked for two hours about the show, about the character, about myself, about my history, how I started acting,” Kaci told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Teen Vogue</a>. “It was a surreal feeling because I looked up to Ms. Ava for so long,” Kaci added. A week after that lunch, Ava officially selected Kaci to lead her new series.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>So what did the famous director see in Kaci? “This young woman is an extraordinary human being. Warm spirit and a person&nbsp;who is lovely and loyal and just filled with light,” Ava said on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Talk</a>&nbsp;days before the&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;premiere. “She’s perfect to play this regular human girl who finds out she’s got something a little special. She’s actually a superhero and she’s really that to all of us. She’s our hero on the set. We love her.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><strong><i>Kaci feels&nbsp;</i><span><span><i>connected</i></span></span><i>&nbsp;to her ‘Naomi’ character.</i></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>In various interviews about&nbsp;Naomi, Kaci has opened up about how she feels similar to the high school teen-turned-super hero that she’s playing on television. “I&nbsp;think that our lives are sometimes mirrored and it’s actually very interesting,” Kaci said in a chat with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider</a>. “We’re often going through the same things. I’ve learned to trust myself more. I’ve learned many things about acting, of course. I’ve learned that we all have a destiny within ourselves and that we all are greater than we may think we are.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>She also told&nbsp;Teen Vogue, “We’re both teenagers. We’re both Black girls. But I think going even deeper than that, we both have a sense of drive and passion within ourselves. When someone tells us, ‘No, you can’t do this,’ that doesn’t mean we’re going to stop … I may not do as Kaci what Naomi does, but I can understand it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kaci-Walfall-5-Things-Naomi-The-CW-embed-2.jpg><h2><strong><i>Kaci has a supportive family.</i></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kaci is about to make it big on&nbsp;Naomi, and her family will be supporting her through the whole journey. In fact, Kaci’s father is super pumped up&nbsp;about his daughter landing a role as a superhero. “My dad always tells me that he’s my biggest fan and he’s super excited,” she told Collider. “My mom is super excited. My younger brother is excited. I called my grandmother when I first got the role. My uncles, my aunts, and my cousins are really excited. And my friends are excited too.”</p><h2><strong><i>Kaci is on Instagram.</i></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Fans of&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;can follow the show’s lead star on Instagram. Kaci currently has nearly 8,000 followers <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on her account</a> — though that number will surely rise soon. She’s been posting plenty of footage related to the show. A week before the&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;premiere, Kaci said she was “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>beyond ecstatic</a>” for the show to start. In late December, she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a clip</a> of her character and called her “an icon in the making.” Kaci also teased that the superhero series is “about to be a crazy ride.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K4oq%2FIZq6apJaWua15zZqmpqFdaYNyhZVwb2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
