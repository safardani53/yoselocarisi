Now, she considers herself “weirdly intuitive and extremely spiritual” — both of which are common traits for Scorpios.</p><p>“I have consulted with an astrologist since the age of 15,” she tells Us.</p><p>Taank is driven to succeed and her success isn’t about what’s written in the stars. She manifests her goals. “I am the self-proclaimed queen of manifesting and have it down to a science,” Taank tells Us. “Whatever I want, I visualize every day and will it into existence — it hasn’t failed me yet.”</p><p>Her next endeavor Taank is manifesting is her own e-commerce platform, <a href=#>Oushq</a>, which is set to launch this fall.</p><p>Scroll down to read 25 things fans might not know about Taank:</p><p>1. I was weirdly obsessed with Sweet Valley High — [both] the books and the show.</p><p>2. I cannot stand cilantro: the smell, the taste, the texture. It’s commonly used in Indian cuisine, and I used to throw a tantrum as a child when it was in my food. My mum thought she was outsmarting me by blending it into her cooking but I was so sensitive to it. I knew it was there and refused to eat.</p><p>3. I had a private Japanese tutor growing up and can converse in Japanese.</p><p>4. As a child, I thought <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> was my real dad and my parents had kidnapped me from him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jessel-Tank-exclusively-tells-Us-Weekly-25-things-8.jpg><p>5. I tell everyone my favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption, but really, it’s <a href=#>Clueless</a>.</p><p>6. We were huge fans of the WWF/WWE, and I still know all the wrestlers’ names and finishing moves, i.e. the British Bulldog’s Running Powerslam.</p><p>7. My celeb crush growing up was <strong><a href=#>Joshua Jackson</a></strong>, a.k.a. Pacey from <a href=#>Dawson’s Creek</a>.</p><p>8. I am the self-proclaimed queen of manifesting and have it down to a science. Whatever I want, I visualize every day and will it into existence — it hasn’t failed me yet.</p><p>9. I used to keep a diary during my teens and had written down in 1995: “live in NY, work in fashion and have twin boys.”</p><p>10. My guilty pleasure is McDonald’s chicken nuggets with BBQ sauce.</p><p>11. I know the words to almost every Bollywood song and am a Bollywood aficionado.</p><p>12. When it comes to fashion, I mainly style myself. I’m very confident in what works for me and always go with my gut.</p><p>13. Indian fashion has always been a way to escape for me: I used to dress up as a child and pretend I was a princess!</p><p>14. I’m extremely clumsy and can somehow fall even while standing still.</p><p>15. My most creative and most impactful ideas come to me while I’m in the shower.</p><p>16. My brother and I used to go to karate class, then come home and watch <a href=#>The Karate Kid</a> to practice our moves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jessel-Tank-exclusively-tells-Us-Weekly-25-things-3.jpg><p>17. I have a fear of mosquitoes, especially when they buzz by your ear when you’re sleeping.</p><p>18. I made the first move on my husband, <a href=#><strong>Pavit</strong> [<strong>Randhawa</strong>]</a>.</p><p>19. I love to eat Doritos on planes.</p><p>20. My pet peeve is people who chew loudly.</p><p>21. If I could live anywhere in the world, it would be in a gorgeous villa in Bali.</p><p>22. I love wearing men’s cologne; my all-time favorite is Cool Water.</p><p>23. I’m weirdly intuitive and extremely spiritual.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. I have consulted with an astrologist since the age of 15.</p><p>25. I always wonder what the world would be like if <a href=#>Tupac</a> and <a href=#>The Notorious B.I.G.</a> were still alive. I think about it frequently.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BjxrR5yZ6qrJ2cYsGirc2kZK2gn6q0qcCMpqCcoJGauW62wJyirKeeYsSiv4yhnKtllJaxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
