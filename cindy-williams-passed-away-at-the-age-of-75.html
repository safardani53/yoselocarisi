She made her acting debut as Lydia in My World and Welcome to It in 1970.&nbsp;Other films in which she has appeared include Barefoot in the Park, Drive, He Said, Room 222, and Beware! Among the many films are The Blob, The Killing Kind, Hawaii Five-O, Cannon, Police Story, More American Graffiti, The Creature Wasn‚Äôt Nice, When Dreams Come True, and Tricks of the Trade. Williams told The Los Angeles Times in 1993 about how she prepared for the roles that made her a household name:</p><p>‚ÄúWhen you meet folks with similar views, it‚Äôs entertaining and lovely to watch them. The attitudes of the characters reflect characteristics of oneself. Typically, the characters you portray in sitcoms are close to you. They are rhythms inside yourself that you play really well.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cindy-Williams-1.jpg alt="Cindy Williams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Williams married her Room 222 co-star Bill Hudson in 1982. They had two children together, Emily and Zachary, before splitting up in 2000. Cindy appeared on Laverne & Shirley through the seventh season and did not return for the eighth due to her marriage and pregnancy.&nbsp;She said on the Today program in 2015 how her contract required her to work on her due date.</p><p>‚ÄúI imagined I‚Äôd come back and they‚Äôd cover [the baby bump] beneath benches, sofas, and pillows, but that wasn‚Äôt the case. When it came time to sign my contract for that season, they had me working on my baby‚Äôs due date. ‚ÄòYou know, I can‚Äôt sign this,‚Äô I remarked. And it went back and forth and back again, and it never got resolved.‚Äù</p><p>She filed a $20 million lawsuit against Paramount and the show‚Äôs producer, which was eventually resolved. According to Us Weekly, Cindy Williams claimed that despite her celebrity, she kept loyal to herself since she hailed from a ‚Äúregular home.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cindy-Williams.jpg alt="Cindy Williams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been through some strange periods in my life. In the 1960s, I was a hippy. But, in general, I‚Äôm rather typical. At night, I like to walk around the house and turn out all the lights. I sometimes return the hangers to the dry cleaners so they may be reused.‚Äù</p><p>On the professional front, she was most recently seen as Luann on The Pack Podcast.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoqaUrnq4tculoJqlo2K9or%2FSnptmmaeWxm6t02aroZ1dlrSmec6fZHBtXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
