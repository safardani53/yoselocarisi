The former handbag designer alleged that she gave $10,000 of the loan to her mom before returning the rest of the money back to Connor.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Baumgartner filed for divorce from Costner, 68 — with <a href=#>whom share sons Cayden, 15, Logan, 14 and daughter Grace, 12</a> — in May after nearly 19 years of marriage, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the split. The pair have been involved<a href=#> in a messy legal battle</a>&nbsp;over property and child support ever since. (An intern ruling in July order Costner to pay Baumgartner <a href=#>$129,755 per month for their children’s care</a> in addition to $200,000 in attorney’s fees and $100,000 in forensic costs.)</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Earlier this month, Costner claimed that while he was faithful during the marriage he “does not know” whether Baumgartner can say the same. In a request by Baumgartner for financial documents, he revealed that he couldn’t provide any receipts “relating to extramarital romantic relationships” because they do not exist.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“[Kevin] does not know for a fact if [Christine] engaged in <a href=#>any ‘extramarital romantic relationships’</a> before separation and, if so, whether she spent any of his money or charged any expenses in furtherance of her affair(s) on credit cards he paid,” Costner’s lawyers stated at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Costner’s response was attached to Baumgartner’s latest request for order, which was filed on August 21. Baumgartner claimed in her filing that Costner has been “stonewalling” their divorce process by refusing to hand over certain documents <a href=#>before their next child support meeting</a>. The pair will head to trial in November to determine the validity of their prenuptial agreement.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>This is not the first time Costner has <a href=#>questioned Baumgartner’s fidelity amid their divorce</a>. Earlier this year, Costner’s former tenant</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0><strong>Daniel Starr</strong> shut down rumors he had an affair with Baumgartner prior to her split from Costner. “They’re going through a divorce. They have kids, I feel really badly,” Starr told TMZ in June. “I hope that they can peacefully resolve that.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Starr previously rented a home located <a href=#>on Costner’s property in Santa Barbara, California</a>. His rental agreement was set to end in June but he vacated the premises in March. Starr said he left early simply because he “had to move on” but said he was “absolutely not” involved in a romantic relationship with Baumgartner.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZ5km5mlorSivtOnnKtlnqTBbrDAraCnn12axW63xK%2Bgp2WTpMC1usSrqmaeop6yr7CO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
