This year’s tournament will mark the fifth time that <a href=#>Lewis has taken part in the charity event</a>, which features English celebrities and soccer legends playing against a team of international players to raise money for UNICEF U.K. “So, she’s with us. … She’s with us again this year.”</p><p>McCrory’s spirit was also felt at the memorial service that Lewis recently held for her. The memorial was attended by some of the Peaky Blinders actress’ famous friends, including <a href=#><strong>Helena Bonham Carter</strong></a> and Bodyguard star <a href=#><strong>Keeley Hawes</strong></a>.</p><p>“That [service] we had the other day … was a special day, I’m very glad [so many people] could have been part of it,” he said. “She was <a href=#>celebrated by, you know, her tribe, her profession</a>, the acting profession – actors, directors, producers, writers – all showed up and she’s much, much missed,” the Billions star added, describing his late wife as a “fabulous human being.”</p><p>In April 2021, <a href=#>Lewis, who married McCrory in 2007</a>, revealed that <a href=#>the Skyfall actress had died at the age of 52</a>, following a private battle with breast cancer. “I’m heartbroken to announce that <a href=#>after a heroic battle with cancer</a>, the beautiful and mighty woman that is Helen McCrory has died peacefully at home, surrounded by a wave of love from friends and family,” the Golden Globe nominee — who shares daughter Manon, 15, and son Gulliver, 14, with his late wife — wrote via Twitter at the time. “She died as she lived. Fearlessly.”</p><p>He continued: “God, we love her and know how lucky we are to have had her in our lives. She blazed so brightly. Go now, Little One, into the air, and thank you.”</p><p>In the days following her death, <a href=#>Lewis gushed about the Harry Potter star</a> in a touching eulogy for the Sunday Times, writing that she was “an even more brilliant person than she was an actress.”</p><p>“I’ve never known anyone able to enjoy life as much,” he continued in the April 2021 essay. “<a href=#>Her ability to be in the present and enjoy the moment</a> was inspirational. Nor was she interested in navel-gazing. No real interest in self-reflection; she believed in looking out, not in. Which is why she was able to turn her light so brightly on others.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The England native added that <a href=#>their children “have in them the fearlessness</a>, wit, curiosity, talent and beauty of their mother,” and revealed that before her death, McCrory wanted them to know that she had “lived the life I wanted to” and loved them deeply. “She’s shown no fear, no bitterness, no self-pity, only armed us with the courage to go on and insisted that no one be sad, because she is happy.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Tom Felton</strong></a>, who <a href=#>played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films</a>, also shared a heartfelt tribute to his onscreen mother shortly after her death “I never took the chance to tell her, but she helped shape me as a person so much — on & off screen,” <a href=#>the 33-year-old wrote via Instagram</a> at the time. “She was always relentlessly herself — razor sharp wit – silver tongued – kind & warm hearted — she suffered no fools yet had time for everyone — thank you for lighting the way forward & holding my hand when I needed it xx.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ2erq95y56uoqtdpa66v4ytqaKapamybsDOZp2amqWhvLa%2FjKWYrZ1drLansYyhnKWdnmK6pK%2FRqKmyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
