The Eagles didn’t offer the tight end an extension last season, owing to their cap woes, the presence of Dallas Goedert, and what ended up as a disastrous campaign for the veteran.</p><p>Ertz set career lows across the board in virtually every measure of any kind, a scary sign for a player who just turned 30. On top of all that, Ertz’s $12.7 million cap hit is the largest at his position in 2021.</p><p>The Eagles can save $8.5 million in cash and on their 2021 cap by moving on, but Ertz is not going to have a market at that price tag.</p><p>Ertz would probably be looking at something in the $3 million to $4 million range on a one-year deal if he were released, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he took a pay cut as part of a deal.”</p><h2>Zach Ertz – Net Worth and salary</h2><p>Notably, it has been over seven years since Zach began playing in the NFL.
