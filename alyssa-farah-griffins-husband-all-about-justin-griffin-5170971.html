She revealed that while they were doing long distance, her then-boyfriend broke up with her, but she had the perfect strategy to get back together: thirst trap. &nbsp;“My husband and I went on one brief hiatus a few months into dating, we were doing long distance. He broke up with me. I was devastated. But how do you get him back? Post a sexy beachside photo,” she said in a January 2023 episode of The View,&nbsp;per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;“He was calling me the next day and we were back together within a few days.”</p><h2>Justin Works as a Business and Communications Consultant</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Justin studied political science at Clark University.

She shared the cute engagement photos on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “Best day with the man of my dreams. Love you forever,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The couple exchanged vows in a ceremony in Vero Beach, Florida on November 6, 2021. The talk show host called it “the best of my life,” when sharing photos from the wedding on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. Alyssa revealed that unfortunately her dad and step-mom wouldn’t come to her wedding because <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she denounced Trump</a>. “I love them. They’re welcome to be there on my end, but if they didn’t want to be there, why would I interrupt my special day?” she said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The View.</a></p><h2>They’ve Discussed Having Children</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>In one of Alyssa’s most shocking moments on The View&nbsp;yet,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Whoopi Goldberg</a>&nbsp;</strong>stopped mid-sentence in a political discussion to ask her if she was pregnant. After the surprising question out of the blue, Alyssa asked why she thought that, and the comedian said she had a glow. Fortunately, Alyssa took it in good spirits, but there was an awkward guest in the studio that day: Justin’s mom. “Oh my God. You can’t say that when my mother-in-law is here!” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>After speaking a little more, Alyssa said that she and Justin were having discussions about having a baby. “I’m very&nbsp;open to being pregnant soon. I am not blessed to be pregnant yet. My husband and I are thinking about it,” she said, before promising to take a pregnancy test.</p><h2>They Have an Adorable Puppy</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>While they don’t have kids yet, Alyssa and Justin are proud parents to an adorable puppy, named Herbie. The talk show host regularly shares adorable photos of the fluffy white dog on her Instagram.
