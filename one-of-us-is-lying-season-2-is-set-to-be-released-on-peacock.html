The plot revolves around five high school kids who go into detention, but things take an unexpected turn when one of them dies and the others are accused of murder. The first season debuted in October 2021 to largely good reviews from both spectators and reviewers.</p><h2>Season 2 of Peacock’s One of Us Is Lying is expected to wow viewers.</h2><p>On September 28, 2022, Peacock released the official teaser for the series’ second season, which gives a glimpse into the lives of the four students after the horrific events of the first season. The clip shows the evolving dynamics of the students’ connection quickly, and viewers can anticipate further character development in the next chapter.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/One-of-Us-Is-Lying-1.jpg alt="One of Us Is Lying" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Overall, the teaser has a tight and dramatic tone, similar to the first season, and fans can expect another suspenseful season full of narrative surprises. Along with the teaser, Peacock released a summary for the new season, stating:</p><p>“Following the suspenseful climax of Season One, the Bayview Four have a deadly secret. We’ll see how far they’ll go in Season Two to defend their secret, themselves, and each other.”</p><p>The previous season was mostly focused on Simon Kelleher’s untimely death. Jake’s complicity in Simon’s murder was perhaps the season’s most shocking revelation. Jake was finally dead, and the Bayview Four, together with Janae, made up a tale about Jake fleeing the country.&nbsp;However, it seems that their secret will be disclosed in the future season since it was previously mentioned that someone knew about Jake’s death. The pupils got a message from a person known as “Simon Says,” and the identity of this person will be revealed in the second season.&nbsp;The second season, like the first, consists of eight episodes, each lasting around one hour.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/One-of-Us-Is-Lying-2.jpg alt="One of Us Is Lying" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>More information about the cast of One of Us Is Lying</h2><p>Annalisa Cochrane, Marianly Tejada, Chibuikem Uche, and Cooper van Grootel play Addy, Brownyn, Cooper, and Nate, respectively, in One of Us Is Lying. Critics have praised all four actors for their passionate performances throughout the first season.</p><p>The series’ principal actors look beautiful in the second season teaser, and fans should anticipate them to produce similarly excellent performances in the upcoming season. Jessica McLeod, Sara Thompson, and Melissa Collazo are among the other cast members. Erica Saleh, widely known for her work on Instinct and Wisdom of the Crowd, is the show’s creator.&nbsp;One of Us Is Lying is based on the book of the same name by famous novelist Karen M. McManus, which gained great critical praise for its interesting tale and thematic depth.&nbsp;The next season of One of Us is Lying will premiere on Peacock on Thursday, October 20, 2022.</p><p></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>One of Us Is Lying</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Peacock</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGimp51dpLNuwdJmoKxlnK62r7OMrJyaq5%2BjenN5yKxkrJ2kYsGwecGeZKudnJqutLHDZqanZaCarqS7wqRm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
