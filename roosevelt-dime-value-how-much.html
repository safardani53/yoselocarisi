href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dimes</a>&nbsp;dates back to the late 1700s when the draped bust pieces were first struck by the US Mint.</p><img

century and a half later, the Roosevelt dimes entered circulation and have become the most common dimes in existence.</p><p>We reveal the most valuable Roosevelt pieces below and everything you need to know about them.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-roosevelt-dime><strong>What is the Roosevelt dime?</strong></h2><p>The first Roosevelt dime was struck by the US mint in 1946, replacing the&nbsp;<a href=#>Mercury design</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON COINS">READ MORE ON COINS</h2><p>The earliest dates of the Roosevelt dimes were made 90% out of silver and 10% out of copper.</p><p>However, the Mint decided to remove the silver.</p><p>Since 1965, Roosevelt coins have been produced with copper-nickel elements.</p><p>The composition breakdown of most Roosevelt&nbsp;<a href=#>coins</a>&nbsp;consists of 92% silver and 8% nickel.</p><p>Roosevelt coins were minted in Philadelphia (P), San Francisco (S), or Denver (D).</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>The letter marks can be found above the date on the obverse, or in the bottom center of the reverse depending on the design.&nbsp;</p><p>However, some coins minted in Philadelphia do not have mintmarks engraved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Finding a rare Roosevelt can be tough given the high volume produced each year.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the lowest reported mintage issued for circulation in the series is the 1955 dime without a letter mark, with production surpassing more than 12million.&nbsp;</p><p>For context, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Washington1932-S quarter</a>&nbsp;has a mintage of just 408,000.</p><p>However, there are a few Roosevelt coins out there that could be quite valuable including ones with&nbsp;<a href=#>errors</a>.</p><h2 id=how-much-are-they-worth><strong>How much are they worth?</strong></h2><p>As always, keep in mind that grade and condition could influence the value of a coin.</p><p>Some of these coins are uncirculated, meaning they are even harder to find because they haven't been released for public circulation.</p><p>A 1965 dated coin described as “MS68 full torch”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;for $805 in a March 2010 auction.</p><p>“As the designation suggests, all design elements are bold and sharply detailed,” the description read.</p><p>Another uncirculated dime dated 1955 without a mintmark graded in MS68&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;for a total of $1,110 in a January 2019 auction.&nbsp;</p><p>As for circulated coins, a 1982 piece without a mintmark could also be quite valuable.</p><p>This is because an employee of the Philadelphia mint accidentally produced a small number of dimes without a letter mark.</p><p>Roughly 8,000 to 10,000 of these coins were found in Sandusky, Ohio.</p><p>Other 1982 pieces without a mintmark were found in Pittsburgh and Boston.</p><p>In a March 2021 auction a 1982 no letter mark Roosevelt dime graded in AU 58&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;for $110.</p><p>One Roosevelt dime with cud error&nbsp;<a href=#>sold</a>&nbsp;for a total of $119.26 on eBay after 15 bids.</p><p>The dime D letter mark above the 1972 date on the obverse.</p><h2 id=how-to-find-rare-coins><strong>How to find rare coins</strong></h2><p>There are many ways you can&nbsp;<a href=#>find rare coins</a>.</p><p>The first thing you’ll want to do is check places in your home or any places you might store change.</p><p>Some other ways include using a metal detector in known areas for buried treasure and by stopping by your local bank branch and asking for a wrapper of pennies.</p><p>You can also try to get a good deal on one online through USA Coin Book or eBay.</p><p>But make sure you research the coin first and know what it’s worth before buying.</p><p>You also need to be aware of potential fakes online.</p><p>To avoid this, it's worth checking the seller’s history and whether or not the coin was certified in the listing.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on
