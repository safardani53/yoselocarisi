"I used to sleep until noon, but it's not so bad to have to get up at 7 and give them breakfast. My daughter made me realize that if there's anything that's going to make a man of you, it's having your will broken by a little girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Law prefers to keep his younger children out of the spotlight, his adult children with Frost are starting to follow in their famous parents' acting footsteps, though neither Law nor Frost pushed them to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't think they felt strongly either way," Law's eldest son Rafferty told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ Hype</a> in 2021 of his parent's reaction to his decision to pursue acting. "They've been watching me in school plays since I was 5 and it's always been something I've loved doing, as well as music and writing, so they've been very supportive of me and my siblings following our passions and dreams. For them, if you work hard at something, the rewards pay off."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He also opened up about what it was like having famous parents, noting that he wasn't aware of their celebrity status until he was older.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That was really credit to them. … [They were] always there for us, just as our parents," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Law and Frost's daughter Iris, who is also an actress, shared a similar sentiment in a 2018 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ES Magazine</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My parents weren't rock 'n' roll when I was growing up, they were just my parents," she said.

"I think if anyone can be passionate about anything, that's a good first step. [Rafferty's] also very realistic — he works hard. He's a good boy and I love him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In his 2021 interview with GQ Hype, Raff discussed constantly being <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>compared to his dad</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's that comparison all the time and I find it quite funny, because obviously we're going to look quite similar — he's my dad," he told the outlet. "It's nice because we do have similarities and we are so close, so now that I'm older he can help me work on scripts and I can send him my music and he can say, 'Yeah, that's great.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added: "He's just happy to see me becoming a young man that he's proud to call his son."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Paul Gilham/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Wonderland cover story</a> — which was photographed by his mom when the family was quarantining together in 2020 — Raff noted "there have been advantages and disadvantages" in having a well-known family, saying, "I've always focused on pursuing the things I love and proving to people that I'm hardworking."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Law and Raff have starred in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Brioni</a> campaign together, and the younger Law said he hopes that won't be the last time they work together. "We always talk about one day if the right thing comes along ... but nothing anytime soon," Rafferty told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>5Eleven Magazine</a> in 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor-model also shared that he takes inspiration from his father's career, saying, "I've recently started looking up to my dad's story and speaking to him about how he found his way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>, he is currently dating actress Rosa Ramirez.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-iris-tallulah-elizabeth-law-22></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Iris Tallulah Elizabeth Law, 22</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Law and Frost welcomed Iris Tallulah Elizabeth Law, their only daughter and second child, in London on Oct. 25, 2000.

"My dad always encouraged me and my siblings to express ourselves through our clothes and choose what we liked."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to her education, Iris is also pursuing a modeling career — she signed with IMG Models in 2019 and has walked runways for Versace, Roberto Cavalli and Missoni, among others. She was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>named a Burberry Beauty ambassador</a> in 2017 and, four years later, became Dior Beauty's U.K. ambassador.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2021, she made her first front-row appearance for Dior's spring/summer 2022 show in Paris and debuted a bleach-blonde buzz cut. She told British Vogue, "I wanted to do something that felt liberating. The day I shaved my head, I changed my life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her acting career is also taking off. Iris has appeared in the 2022 Hulu miniseries Pistol and in the 2021 film I've Been Trying to Tell You.

He gives me great tips," she told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Evening Standard</a> in 2021. "But more generally I've been brought up with morals, not necessarily to do with acting but for life. I've always been told to be polite, to be on time, to be attentive, to work really hard."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She made it clear that she wasn't "pushed" into the industry, noting that she "was always very academic and focused on school."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Iris Law durring the Victoria's Secret Celebrates The Tour '23.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Iris Law Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Iris has already made a name for herself.
