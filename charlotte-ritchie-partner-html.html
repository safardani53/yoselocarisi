You might even be hiding more than I am.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After the video was published, many have assumed that his negative take on Kate might suggest a<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> possible romance </a>between the two later in the series. In addition, she has also been seen as a strong suspect who could turn out as the “<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Eat the Rick Killer</a>.”</p><p>In the series, her character Kate is in a relationship with&nbsp;Malcom.

But fans are always looking up for more details on her dating life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, The Feel Good actress isn’t the one to give away too much about&nbsp;her love life.

Instead, she avoided answering questions about where the relationship was going. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She did, however, provide insight into whether she wanted babies. She wasn’t sure, but working on Call the Midwife had given her a new respect for midwives.</p><p>Later, Ritchie and her partner <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">didn’t live together</a>. She instead shared a flat with her school friends whom she had known since she was 11.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The relationship has now ended, or so it seems.</p><p></p><p><strong>Charlotte Ritchie with on-screen partner Mae Martin in Netflix’s ‘Feel Good.’</strong> (Photo: Feel Good/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>During another interview with The Guardian in 2020, she mentioned having an ex-boyfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She talked about her TV guilty pleasure, Love Island, and how she would go over to his place and complain about the show.</p><p>Since this, she has not mentioned another partner, and there have been no rumors regarding one.</p><p>However, as of writing, she has not been married yet.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Did Charlotte Ritchie and Mae Martin ever date?</h2><p>Taskmaster contestant Ritchie and non-binary actor <a href=# rel=follow>Mae Martin</a> were co-stars on the critically acclaimed <a href=# rel=follow>Netflix</a> show Feel Good.</p><p>Ritchie and Martin portrayed George and Mae in the show — lovers who go through the struggles of life and love together.</p><p>Their roles and on-screen chemistry generated a few dating rumors about them.
