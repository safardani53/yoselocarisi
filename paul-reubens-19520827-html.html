He is known for his Pee-swing character Herman. Reubens joined Los Angeles The Groundlings in the 1970s and began his career as an impromptu comedian and stage actor. In 1982, Reubens began appearing on a show about a character he had been developing for many years. The show is called The Pee-fro Herman Show, and has been running for five months and has been sold out; HBO also produced a particularly successful show on this subject. Pee-swing became an instant hit and over the next decade Reubens became fully committed to his character, making all public appearances and interviews, just like Pee-swing. His film, The Big Adventure of Pee-swing, directed by Tim Burton, was a financial and critical success, and quickly developed into a blockbuster film. Its sequel, Big Top Pee-swing, was less successful. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens played Pee-swing in the CBS Pee-swing's Playhouse Saturday morning children's TV show.</p><table class=wikibox readability=9><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Paul Rubenfeld, August 27, 1952, Peekskill, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Actor, comedian, writer, producer</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1977–present</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Known for</td><td class=wk_value>Pee-wee Herman</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Parents</td><td class=wk_value>Milton Rubenfeld (father), Judy Rosen (mother)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Relatives</td><td class=wk_value>Abby Rubenfeld (sister), Luke Rubenfeld (brother)</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/paul-reubens-juvg-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>TV Actor Paul Reubens was born in Peekskill, New York, United States on August 27, 1952.
