That maybe it would be better if I'd never been born.”</p><p>Despite her hefty weight, Amber always believed she ate a healthy diet - and put her excess pounds down to eating more food than she should.</p><p>She says she used to use food to control feelings of anxiety and deal with fears of failure.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>But eventually her comfort eating got out of hand and took it’s toll.</p><p>“My relationship with food is unhealthy," she said while at her heaviest. &nbsp;</p><p>“I spend a lot of the day stressing about what I'm going to eat and when I'm going to get it.</p><p>“There's anticipation before I eat but it's not enjoyable.

I don't have to think about how I have let everyone around me down. It's a distraction.”</p><p>Realising she needed to change, Amber finally sought the help of a bariatric specialist as her family relocated to Houston, <a href=#>Texas</a> in the US.</p><p>She went under the knife months later, receiving life-saving gastric surgery in 2014.</p><p>It ultimately proved to be a turning point as Amber shed dozens of pounds and became motivated to completely overhaul her lifestyle.</p><p>She made changes to her diet and started going to the gym regularly.</p><p>Amber also reached out to a therapist for professional help, where she learned to manage her anxiety and better understand her past coping mechanisms.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Documenting her incredible transformation on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> page, Amber now posts body positive images online and quips that she’s now “just normal-fat.”</p><p>Posting one selfie, she told her 260k followers: “I'll never be thin but I think I've made peace with it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/my600lblife-tv-show-subject-i-781043981.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/my600lblife-tv-show-subject-i-781043988.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ313gpVrbG9np6S6orqMsJyin5iasW6yyJ%2BrsmWjqbyvsYyupaudk6S0r7XSmpmlnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
