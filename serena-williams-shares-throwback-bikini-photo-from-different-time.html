Her brunette locks were twisted into an updo, and she donned a fresh face as she showed off her abs and belly button piercing.</p><p>The tennis icon originally posted the pic seven years ago in <a href=# rel=noopener>July 2016</a>. At the time, she had not yet married husband <a href=#><strong>Alexis Ohanian</strong></a> and had not given birth to her<a href=#> two daughters</a>: Olympia, 6, and Adria, 2 months.</p><p>Williams announced her second pregnancy at the <a href=#>2023 Met Gala</a> in May, showing off her <a href=#>growing baby bump</a> in a Gucci gown. She teamed the garment with layers of pearl necklaces, a bedazzled headband, a cropped blazer and knee-high boots. “Was so excited when<a href=#> <strong>Anna Wintour</strong></a> invited the 3 of us to the Met Gala,” she captioned a red carpet pic.</p><p>In August, she announced <a href=#>Adria’s arrival</a> with a sweet family photo. In the snap, Williams cradled her newborn while Olympia and Alexis wrapped their arms around her.</p><p>Ohanian also shared a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>sweet message</a> of his own to welcome Adria. “I’m grateful to report our house is teaming with love: a happy & healthy <a href=#>newborn girl</a> and happy & healthy mama,” he wrote at the time. “Feeling grateful. @serenawilliams you’ve now given me another incomparable gift — you’re the GMOAT. Thanks to all the amazing medical staff who took care of my wife & our daughter 🙏 I’ll never forget the moment I introduced @olympiaohanian to her baby sister.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Serena-Williams-Shares-a-Bikini-Pic-From-a-Very-Different-Time-Instagram.jpg><p>The couple tied the knot in November 2017, two months after Olympia was born. In the February 2018 issue of <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a>, Williams opened up about experiencing complications that led to her requiring an emergency C-section.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The following year, she opened up to <a href=# rel=noopener>Allure</a> about her <a href=#>postpartum journey</a> in a January 2019 interview. “I’m feeling pretty good about my body. I worked hard at it in the past eight months to get back from the baby,” she said. “It hasn’t been easy. I’m not 21 anymore. But I did it slow and steady. After I came out [of the hospital], I had a stomach, but I thought, This is kind of cool. I have a stomach because the baby was there.”</p><p>Williams has since announced her <a href=#>retirement from pro tennis</a>, noting in an August 2022 Vogue essay that it wasn’t “fair” for women to “have to choose” between their<a href=#> careers and families</a>. “If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family,” she wrote. “Maybe I’d be more of a<a href=#><strong> Tom Brady</strong></a> if I had that opportunity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGasnaKau6J51qKjpaGRosBuv8eaqZ6rXam1s7vWm5ico12Xtqy1zaJkqaCfqbxustGopGacmZuzpr7Ep6tmrJmisnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
