MTV's The Hills hooked viewers with its complicated love triangles, explosive fights, and emotional breakdowns — but as the series' stars have revealed repeatedly since the show's finale in July 2010, a good portion of those dramatic moments were fabricated by producers. Appearing on the Friday, Dec. 20, episode of <a href=#><strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong></a>'s talk show Bethenny, <a href=#><strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong></a> dished on just how "real" her life on The Hills was — or wasn't.</p><p>"I faked relationships, faked fights," the 26-year-old former MTV star told Frankel. "I don't care anymore — I can tell you. At this point, it's been so many years."</p><p>(Cavallari first appeared on Laguna Beach for two seasons from 2004 to 2005. She joined The Hills in 2009, replacing departing lead <a href=#><strong>Lauren Conrad</strong></a>.)</p><p>One example of a "fake relationship"? Her alleged reconciliation with ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a> in season six.</p><p>"Brody Jenner at the time was dating Jayde Nicole," Cavallari recalled. " I dated Brody when I was 18, right after Laguna Beach, actually, and that's it. And then on the show, on The Hills, they had us 'dating' for a few episodes. They pretended that him and Jayde broke up and I was dating Brody, and Jayde and I got into a huge fight because she saw us in a club. It wasn't real at all. They were together the entire time."</p><p>The Chinese Laundry shoe designer said both Laguna Beach and The Hills were "very much like soap operas." However, she looks at them as "two completely different shows."</p><p>"[On] Laguna Beach, they really just manipulated situations and put us in situations that we normally wouldn't have been in, or we'd have to film something that maybe happened a month ago or hasn't happened yet — stuff like that," she explained. "When I decided to join The Hills, I knew exactly what I was getting into, I knew exactly the character they wanted me to be, so I said, 'Listen, I'm game. What do you want me to do?'"</p><p>The recently married star — she's expecting her second child with husband <strong>Jay Cutler</strong> — learned early to separate her real life from her life on the show. But some of her costars — for example, <a href=#><strong>Heidi Montag</strong></a> — had a harder time with it.</p><p>"I have to say, Heidi is one of the sweetest, nicest girls I think I've ever met. She has such a good heart, and I really mean that. I think she just got caught up in all the hype, which is easy to do," Cavallari told Frankel. "I mean, I get it. When I was 18, I probably got caught up in the hype a little bit, too. But she's still the same person inside. I still talk to Heidi all the time."</p><p>The mom-to-be also spoke with Frankel about her second pregnancy. (She and Cutler are already parents to son <strong>Camden</strong>, 16 months.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"We find out [the gender] really soon," she shared. "I'm gonna have my doctor write it on a piece of paper, and we're gonna open it on Christmas together."</p><p>For more from Kristin Cavallari, tune in to Bethenny on Friday, Dec. 20, on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKroaOptq95wpqtmqSclr%2BqechmnZqjlZl6s7HLmquip56otaq80madmqOVmXqntcahq6xln6N6tbTEZp%2BipJyoenN8kGxpaWliZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
