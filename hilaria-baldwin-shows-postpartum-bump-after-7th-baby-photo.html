We are so excited to introduce you to our tiny dream come true, ilaria catalina irena [sic]. 9-22-22 🤍✨ 6lbs 13oz🤍✨,” she wrote at the time. “Her Baldwinito siblings are spending the day bonding and welcoming her into our home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hilaria-Baldwin-Shows-%E2%80%986-Week-Postpartum-Bump-After-Giving-Birth-to-Her-7th-Child-2.jpg><p>Along with the newborn, the fitness guru <a href=#>shares kids Carmen, 9, Rafael, 7, Leonardo, 6, Romeo, 4, Eduardo, 2, and Lucia, 20 months,</a> with Alec, 64. The actor, for his part, is also the father of daughter Ireland, 27, with his ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Kim Basinger</strong></a>.</p><p>After welcoming the latest addition to her family, the Living Clearly Method author opened up about<a href=#> the challenges of juggling such a big brood.</a></p><p>“Making sure my other babies feel they have mama time too,” she wrote in an Instagram Story shortly after giving birth. “Bringing baby home is magical … and it’s always a transition that we all feel. I am trying to balance new mom again, with breastfeeding, healing and hustling to make sure all my children feel that I am there to be the best mama I can be.”</p><p>Hilaria added: “Am I getting right? Def not all the time. Mama guilt? Obviously. Emotions: all over the place. Seventh time around, I know this is a process.”</p><p>At the time, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Hilaria and Alec <a href=#>have grown closer amid their daughter’s arrival.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hilaria-Baldwin-Shows-%E2%80%986-Week-Postpartum-Bump-After-Giving-Birth-to-Her-7th-Child-3.jpg><p>“Hilaria is a pro at being a mom. It’s second nature to her now. She feels completely blessed and couldn’t be happier,” the insider shared in September. “Her and Alec make such a great team and have this unbreakable bond. They’re focused on their family at this time and getting settled in with Ilaria — that’s what matters most to them.”</p><p>Late last month, the “Mom Brain” podcast host revealed <a href=#>she wasn’t ruling out another pregnancy</a>. “I would have said before [that I’m] definitely done,” she exclusively told Us. “Seven kids in, I feel like I am, but it’s Alec and me — so, time will tell!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hilaria also addressed some of the <a href=#>harder aspects of life as a mother of seven</a>. “Being truly present for each one of them is hard, and I obviously don’t get it right all the time,” she detailed. “My two oldest have nightly homework that I do with them, and to balance play with the younger ones, breast-feeding the youngest — it can get to be quite a juggle.”</p><p>She continued: “It doesn’t matter if you have one kid or a million, I think many parents feel like we are never enough. This is where I’m trying to lean into self-compassion, realizing that I’m only one person trying her best, and by being kind to myself, I set a healthier example for my kids to be kind to themselves too.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGahoZyWv6qtjJuYpZynnrtuv8eorqxloKTAtbzAq6uupV2Xwq68jJqdrZ2iYoS1tIybmJuxXaW1sMDOaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
