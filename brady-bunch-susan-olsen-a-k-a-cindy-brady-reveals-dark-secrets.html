Jan) and Maureen McCormick (who played Marcia), Olsen admitted that things were not always bright and sunny in the Brady household.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Olsen revealed that the two ladies do not get along. "I think it's kind of petty," Olsen said of the longstanding feud. "From day one with these two I have always been in the middle, and now it's at the point where there isn't even a desire to communicate through me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Olsen also aired the show's dirty laundry regarding her salary, saying the Brady crew did not earn much back then. "We even had to pay for our own parking in the first season," Olsen said. "They wouldn't let us drive onto the lot. We earn very, very little."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later on, she found a more lucrative – and illegal at the time – gig: "I guess technically … I was really a marijuana grower," she said. "My husband at the time and I grew it hydroponically."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the actress says she never enjoyed smoking marijuana, she explains, "I've always been into 'gardening,' and it's such a complicated, wonderful, fascinating plant," Olsen said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKO%2BwJ2wZpqlo7CpedKuqpqmXaS5tLHNZphmo12WeqS1zZ2wZpqilrG6edGerZ6ZnKh6pa3RpGSsnZOnsrW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
