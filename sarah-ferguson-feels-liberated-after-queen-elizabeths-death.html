Noting that the queen was “more a mother to me than my own mother,” the My Story author added, “Now she’s not there anymore, I feel as though maybe I can be free to be Sarah. I feel as though I’m liberated from my own mental shackles.”</p><p>Ferguson’s history with the British royal family goes deep. She <a href=#>grew up</a> alongside <a href=#><strong>Prince Andrew</strong></a> before the pair reconnected as adults. They got engaged in 1985 and tied the knot one year later, welcoming daughters <a href=#><strong>Princess Beatrice</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Princess Eugenie</strong></a> in 1988 and 1990, respectively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sarah-Ferguson-Says-She-is-Liberated-Following-Queen-Elizabeth-II-Death-3.jpg><p>Amid allegations that Andrew, 63, was unfaithful to his then-wife, the royal couple called it quits in 1992 after six years of marriage. The finalized <a href=#>their divorce</a> in 1996.</p><p>The exes have remained friendly over the years, even after Andrew stepped back from his senior royal role <a href=#>in 2019</a>. At the time, he denied <strong>Virginia Roberts Giuffre</strong>’s <a href=#>sexual assault accusations</a>, as <a href=#>his connection</a> to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein was called into question. Giuffre later filed a <a href=#>lawsuit</a> against the prince in August 2021, and the case was settled for an unspecified sum <a href=#>in February 2022</a>. Amid the drama, Andrew was <a href=#>stripped of his royal an military titles</a>.</p><p>Ferguson — also known by the nickname “Fergie” — has been candid about her highs and lows with the royal family, but always respected her former mother-in-law, whom she called “an iconic legend” while chatting with ET. “I would be very ignorant if I did not study every time I was with Her Majesty, just ask questions … [I would ask], ‘How do you manage with a new prime minister? How do you manage to filter chaos as well as you do?'” she said on Monday. “I also thought how lucky I was ’cause every single moment I was with Her Majesty I felt such an honor … I have been the luckiest girl, I really have.”</p><p>The Finding Sarah writer had a special bond with the queen, but she admitted that a “switch” went off following her divorce from Andrew, allowing her to “feel free to be myself.” She stated: “The switch was I think realizing I had a career, and I wasn’t just the duchess, and that I’m a strong, redhead, and it’s OK to be strong, it’s OK to be very colorful and feisty.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sarah-Ferguson-Says-She-is-Liberated-Following-Queen-Elizabeth-II-Death-2.jpg><p>When news broke of Elizabeth’s death in September 2022, <a href=#>Ferguson shared her condolences</a> with the world. “I am heartbroken by the passing of Her Majesty the Queen,” she tweeted. “She leaves behind an extraordinary legacy: the most fantastic example of duty and service and steadfastness, and a constant steadying presence as our head of state for more than 70 years.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She <a href=#>was in attendanc</a>e at the late monarch’s funeral later that month, mourning alongside her ex-husband and their children. The service was held at Westminster Abbey in London, the same church Ferguson and Andrew were married.</p><p>The former spouses were later <a href=#>given custody</a> of two of the queen’s Pembroke Welsh corgis.
