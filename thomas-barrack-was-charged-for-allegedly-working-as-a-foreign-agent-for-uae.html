The accusation arises from a period from 2016 to 2018, when Thomas Barrack allegedly unlawfully collaborated with the UAE to boost Trump’s campaign. According to Reuters, UAE authorities reportedly paid Barrack to promote the UAE’s interests in private and directed him on what to say during TV appearances. Prosecutors claim that Barrack exploited his relationships with the UAE to influence Trump’s actions.</p><p>Prosecutors also contend that throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Barrack utilized his personal connection with Trump to influence Trump’s foreign policy opinions. According to CBS, Barrack has been charged with being an agent working for a foreign entity, obstructing justice, and making false statements to law authorities. He was arrested in July 2021 and spent two days in prison before being released on a $250 million bail. Barrack will face these accusations in federal court in Brooklyn later this month, with jury selection beginning on Monday, September 19.</p><h2>Everything there is to know about Thomas Barrack</h2><p>After graduating from USC Gould Law School in 1972, Thomas Barrack, a Lebanese American reared in Culver City, California, started his legal career. According to Fortune, the year he graduated, he started working for a legal company managed by Herbert W. Kalmbach, then the counsel for Richard Nixon.&nbsp;As a result of his tenure at the legal company, he was sent to Saudi Arabia, where he built contacts and worked for members of the Saudi royal family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Thomas-Barrack-1.jpg alt="Thomas Barrack" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the New York Times, Thomas Barrack and Donald Trump’s acquaintance started in 1985, when Barrack had become a renowned investor with investments in several hotels and department shops. Barrack met Trump for the first time after selling him stock in a firm.</p><p>According to Fortune, by 1990, Barrack had built a formidable personal empire with a portfolio worth $25 billion. He is most recognized, though, for his participation in the 2016 US Presidential election, when he backed Donald Trump for President.&nbsp;According to the New York Times, Barrack’s links to Saudi monarchy served a useful function in softening Trump’s image as an Islamophobe.</p><p>Prosecutors say that in the run-up to the 2016 elections, Thomas Barrack contacted multiple UAE officials asking for permission to give speeches by the then-electoral candidate. According to the Wall Street Journal, UAE authorities gave recommendations on who should serve as the American ambassador to Abu Dhabi via Barrack.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Thomas-Barrack-2.jpg alt="Thomas Barrack" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A representative for the UAE indicated in an official statement that they would not comment on the allegations.</p><p>According to the statement:</p><p>“The UAE respects the sovereignty of nations, as well as their laws and regulations, as a matter of principle.”</p><p>In the indictment, Matthew Grimes and Rashid al-Malik are named as accused accomplices to Barrack.
