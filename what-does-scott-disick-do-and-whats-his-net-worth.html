The father of three became a certified TV star since Keeping Up The Kardashians’ inception in 2007 as <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a>‘s boyfriend.</p><p>Fans witnessed the relationship go from its best to worst moments, and after the birth of their third child, Reign, it seemed that the couple was going to eventually marry.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Well, we all know how that turned out – Kourtney and Travis Barker became Hollywood’s most PDA couple, making Scott’s appearances at family gatherings slightly awkward.</p><p>He appeared once during The Kardashians season 2 when <a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a> enlisted his expertise in house flipping, and a second time during the show’s premiere event, but he didn’t speak on camera.</p><p>So with less screen time, how is he keeping himself busy?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/03/GettyImages-1249097957-991x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-scott-disick-do-as-his-job-since-kardashian-fame>What does Scott Disick do as his job since Kardashian fame?</h2><p>Longtime Kardashian fans will know that Scott used his reality stardom to become a frequent nightclub celebrity guest. He jetted between Calabasas and Manhattan for club appearances, some of which earned him up to $80,000 for a few hours of hanging out at a fancy venue. A series of UK events reportedly made him $250,000!</p><p>By 2018, Disick, 39, joined the reality sisters in the world of <a href=#>fashion</a>. His clothing brand, Talentless, was inspired by the hate comments blasting him and his family for being “famous for nothing”.</p><p>“I think it’s a big F-U to everybody in the world that basically said that anybody that was in the reality business 10, 15 years ago didn’t have talent’,” he described.</p><p>Ranging from hoodies to underwear, Talentless is priced up to $139 and has been worn by the likes of Lori Harvey, Addison Rae, and of course, the Kardashians.</p><p>Scott took a shot at the home renovation reality genre with his 2019 series, Flip It Like Disick, during which he renovated luxury Los Angeles properties. The show had an eight-episode run and a second season was never announced. Guess he wasn’t flipping like the El Moussas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/03/GettyImages-1390203519-1-762x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-does-scott-disicks-net-worth-compare-to-the-kardashians>How does Scott Disick’s net worth compare to the Kardashians?</h2><p>He has a reported <a href=#>net worth</a> of $45 million – not too shabby for someone who haters like to label “talentless”. He sits on the same level as Kendall, who is the world’s highest-paid model.</p><p>Scott and Kendall are the members who have the lowest net worth. Unsurprisingly, Kim remains queen with her $1.8 billion, followed by Kylie ($600 million), Kris ($170 million), Kourtney ($65 million), and Khloe ($60 million). Rob has the lowest net worth of $10 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46wn5qsXZm8pr%2BMrJqorKRisaq%2FyJyiZpyfYq6vsIywn5qso2K1qr%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
