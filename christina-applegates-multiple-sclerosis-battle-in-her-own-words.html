A few months ago, I was diagnosed with MS,” the <a href=#>Married … With Children alum</a> wrote via Twitter at the time. “It’s been a strange journey. But I have been so supported by people that I know who also have this condition. It’s been a tough road. But as we all know, <a href=#>the road keeps going</a>. Unless some a—hole blocks it.”</p><p>She continued: “As one of my friends that has MS said, ‘We wake up and take the indicated action’. And that’s what I do. So now I ask for privacy. As I go through this thing. Thank you xo.”</p><p>The California native’s Sweetest Thing costar <a href=#><strong>Selma Blair,</strong></a> who <a href=#>also has the demyelinating disease</a>, was quick to voice her support. “Loving you always. Always here. As are our kids. Beating us up with love,” the Cruel Intentions actress wrote via Twitter.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>National MS Society</a>, the disease affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. Symptoms may include numbness, tingling, pain, fatigue, memory problems, mood changes, blindness and paralysis. Applegate — who welcomed daughter <a href=#>Sadie</a> in 2011 with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Martyn LeNoble</strong></a> — told <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a> that in retrospect, there were warning signs of the illness.</p><p>“I wish I had paid attention,” she said during a November 2022 conversation with the outlet. “But who was I to know?”</p><p>After the Anchorman actress received the life-altering diagnosis, production for <a href=#>season 3 of her Netflix series Dead to Me</a> was halted for five months.</p><p>“There was the sense of, ‘Well, let’s get her some medicine <a href=#>so she can get better</a>,’” the Samantha Who? alum told the NYT. “And there is no better. But it was good for me. I needed to process my loss of my life, my loss of that part of me. So, I needed that time.”</p><p>Applegate added that finishing the show was <a href=#>the hardest thing she’s ever done</a>, but she felt that it needed to happen.</p><p>“I had an obligation to [the series creator] <strong>Liz [Feldman]</strong> and to <a href=#><strong>Linda [Cardellini]</strong></a>, to our story. The powers that be were like, ‘Let’s just stop. We don’t need to finish it. Let’s put a few episodes together. I said, ‘No. We’re going to do it, but we’re <a href=#>going to do it on my terms</a>,'” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She later hinted that her career was coming to a close, telling <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> in May 2023, “I’m probably not going to work on-camera again.”</p><p>Scroll through to see everything Applegate has said about her battle with MS:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKm%2ByKyroqaRYq6xvMuenpqslah6rsHLraCppJViwKS4xKumrKGjYq%2BiwNOlnGahnmK1pr6MqK6nZaekv6W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
