So, we can say loving basketball is in his genes.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Morrison had to move from place to place during his childhood as his Father’s work was like that. Morrison’s Father left coaching when Adam was in fourth grade, and the whole family moved to Washington permanently.</span></p><p><a href=#>If you are interested in knowing more about basketball players, you can also check out this article on<strong> Lamar Patterson’s Bio: Basketball, NBL, ESPN & Stats.</strong></a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Everything was going fine until Adam reached eighth grade.
