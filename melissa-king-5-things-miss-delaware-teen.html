According to her bio, the 18-year-old was a member of the National Society of High School Scholars! She had “exceptionally high SAT scores, GPA, and AP scores.” Melissa’s intelligence earned her a partial scholarship at the College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.</p><h3>#2 She’s A Jock</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>If they gave letterman jackets to girls, Melissa would definitely have one. The former Miss Delaware Teen has competed in gymnastics since she was nine years old. And in high school, Melissa played varsity soccer and cheerleaded for her school’s football, basketball, and wrestling teams.</p><h3>#3 She’s An Artist</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Okay, now this is just getting crazy! But seriously, as a child Melissa won school-wide &nbsp;awards for her pieces and was even awarded Derrickson’s Memorial Art Scholarship. As for her medium? Melissa likes to work with clay and acrylics. And she loves&nbsp;painting monkeys.</p><h3>#4 She Dreams Of Working In The Media</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Melissa’s major at the College of Pennsylvania is Communications. Her bio states that her dream job is to be a journalist, either in sports or fashion. “She hopes to work on the sidelines of an NFL game,” it reads. Actually, we could see that. We still can!</p><h3>#5 She Gives Back To The Community</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Saying a beauty pageant winner frequently volunteers is like saying a beauty pageant winner is pretty — they sort of go hand in hand. Melissa has worked with the American Heart Association and The Woman’s Sports Foundation. Utilizing her love of athletics, also started her own program, called “Finding the Balance,” that works to help people perfect the harmony between emotional, physical, and social health.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>She actually sounds like a pretty great girl to us (minus that whole amateur porn video thing). What do you think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Does all this background make you think differently about Melissa King and her situation? Do you think she can overcome the scandal?
