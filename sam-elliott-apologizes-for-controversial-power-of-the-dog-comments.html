I am.”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “I wasn’t very articulate about it. … And I said some things that hurt people and I feel terrible about that. The gay community has been incredible to me my entire career. And I mean my entire career, from before I got started in this town. Friends on every level and every job description up until today. I’m sorry I hurt any of those friends and someone that I loved. And anyone else by the words that I used.”</p><p class=p1>The California native, who appeared at Sunday’s event with <a href=#>his&nbsp;<i>1883&nbsp;</i>costars</a>, noted that the 2021 film “struck a chord with me.”</p><p class=p1>Elliott made headlines earlier this year after he slammed the movie’s representation of cowboys.</p><p class=p1>“They’re running around in chaps and no shirts. There’s&nbsp;all these allusions of homosexuality&nbsp;throughout the movie,” the&nbsp;<i>Parks and Recreation&nbsp;</i>alum said&nbsp;<a href=#>during the February 28 episode of&nbsp;<strong>Marc Maron</strong>’s “WTF” podcast</a>, referring to the actors as Chippendale dancers who “wear bow ties and not much else” and calling the film a “piece of s—t” as a whole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Sam-Elliott-Slams-Allusions-Homosexuality-Power-of-the-Dog-002.jpg><p class=p1>He also called out the 67-year-old director’s choice to film the movie in her native New Zealand and <a href=#>Cumberbatch’s leading role as rancher Phil Burbank</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Cumberbatch&nbsp;never got out of his f–king chaps. He had two pairs of chaps: a woolly pair and a leather pair,” Elliott said during the podcast appearance, referring to the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Doctor Strange</i>&nbsp;actor</a>, 45. “Every f–king time he would walk in from somewhere — he never was on a horse, maybe once — he’d walk into the f–king house, storm up the f–king stairs, go lay in his bed in his chaps, and play his banjo. It’s like, what the f–k?”</p><p class=p1>The movie, which <a href=#>earned 12 Oscar nominations</a> and <a href=#>a directorial win for Campion</a>, follows Phil Burbank in 1920s rural Montana as he teaches his brother’s new wife and her son how to run the family farm.&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jesse Plemons</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Kodi Smit-McPhee</a>&nbsp;</strong>also star.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The film’s cast and creative time have <a href=#>since been outspoken in defense</a> of the Western-inspired flick.</p><p class=p1>“Beyond that reaction, that sort of denial that anybody could have any other than a heteronormative existence because of what they do for a living or where they’re born, there’s also a massive intolerance within the world at large towards homosexuality still and toward an acceptance of the other and anything kind of difference,” the&nbsp;<i>Sherlock&nbsp;</i>alum <a href=#>said during a March interview with BAFTA Film Sessions</a>. “No more so than in this prism of conformity of what’s expected of a man in the Western archetype mold of masculinity. To deconstruct that through Phil, it’s not a history lesson.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmZ1isq24yKirrWWRpbytu8aisZ6rXZu8s3nCqKWtqp%2BrsrO%2FyJqjZqifrLKzec6fZK2glWKxsLOMnKampZWjwbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
