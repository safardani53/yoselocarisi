He is the youngest son of Rickie Winslow and Robin Davis, both of whom are Texas natives.</p><p>Winslow grew up in Houston and attended St. John’s School as a kid. His father was a good basketball player and played college basketball at the University of Houston.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Justise-Winslow-with-his-mother-Robin-Davis.jpg><p>Not only that, Rickie even played some NBA matches for the Milwaukee Bucks and Chicago Bulls. Justise’s keen interest in basketball developed when he was a small boy due to his father’s influence.</p><p>He studied at St. John’s until he graduated from high school level. While there, he participated in various inter-school tournaments and won numerous accolades.</p><p>Even though his father initially made him practice the sport and honed his skills, his mother, Robin, also motivated him. He and almost everyone in his family are into different kinds of sports.</p><p>One of his elder brothers, Josh, played college football for Dartmouth College and was very good at it. However, he did not get successful enough to pursue his professional career.</p><p>Similarly, Winslow’s elder sister, Bianca, played college-level basketball for the Houston Cougars.</p><p>His two other brothers, Cedrick and Brandon, did not play sports as their other siblings did. However, they loved watching sports and cheered their siblings during their games. Brandon currently works as a real estate agent and advisor.</p><p>Moving back to his academic life, he graduated his high school in 2014 and enrolled at Duke University for his higher education and college career.&nbsp;</p><h2>Justise Winslow | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Justise played his high school basketball for St. John’s School, the same school he had attended since childhood. He soon stood out as one of the best from the first year among his teammates.</p><p>He won the league championship in his first year, in which he made a significant contribution. For his performance, young Winslow received applause from his school coaches, which boosted his confidence.</p><p>He did even better in the next seasons, and his tall height certainly helped a lot. Justise displayed his career-best performance in his senior season when he averaged 27.5 points and 13.6 rebounds per game.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Myles Turner Bio: Net Worth, NBA & Injury >>></strong></a></p><p>He again assisted them in winning the league championship in his final year.

He played 39 matches and started all of them in his rookie season.</p><p><strong>Mike Krzyzewski</strong>, the then coach at Duke, became impressed with his game, due to which he compared his playing style with the former Blue Devils legends <strong>Tommy Amaker</strong> and <a href=#>Grant Hill</a>.</p><p>He finished the intercollegiate season with 12.6 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. In addition, Winslow competed in the NCAA tournament and contributed to his team winning the championship.</p><p>He averaged 14.3 points and 9.3 rebounds per game throughout the event.</p><p>Winslow decided to forgo his college career after his first year and decided to go for the NBA draft in April 2015.

Eventually, they traded him to the LA Clippers in 2021.</p><p>He appeared for around 37 games for the Clippers, in which he had one of the worst performances in his NBA career. Not only was he bad at scoring, but he did not have good rebounding records as well.</p><p>Finally, on February 4, the Clippers traded him to the Portland Trail Blazers during the ongoing 2021-22 season.
