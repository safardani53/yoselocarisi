They were then seen packing on the PDA at Coachella in April 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, an insider told PEOPLE that Madix — who had just ended a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nine-year relationship with Sandoval</a> — wasn't looking to rush into anything "serious."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, by May 2023, a source told PEOPLE that Madix was already "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>falling in love</a>" with Wai.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's happening faster than she thought but he treats her well, they're having fun, and she's happy to be moving on to this next chapter with such an incredible guy," the insider said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for everything to know about Madix's boyfriend, Wai.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hes-from-new-york></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He's from New York</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Daniel Wai/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wai calls the city of New York his home. While it's unknown what college he went to, he studied computer science, business and math while enrolled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On top of his course load to attain his degree, Wai intertwined his passion for physical fitness, taking part in weight training and enrolling in boxing classes. "Although my passion was driving me towards physical fitness, logic was pointing me towards full time employment in a corporation," he wrote on his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>personal website</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-pursued-a-career-in-consulting></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He pursued a career in consulting</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After graduating college, Wai pursued a career in consulting, of which some of his clients included Fortune 500 companies. However, his fitness mindset shifted his focus to the gym — ultimately, working double duty as a part-time trainer before and after his nine-to-five job.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Wai's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>website</a>, his consulting job had him traveling many hours around the country to meet his clients' needs. After various years of that grind, he "made an executive decision" to continue his work as a consultant, but from his home in N.Y.C.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the change in location and pace, Wai said the consulting job was "neither fulfilling nor inspiring" in comparison to the training job he picked up on the side. In fact, he wrote that it "changed my entire outlook on life."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-quit-his-consulting-job-to-be-a-full-time-trainer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He quit his consulting job to be a full-time trainer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Daniel Wai/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To completely fulfill his passion, he decided to quit his job in consulting and pursue a career as a trainer full-time. After passing his National Academy of Sports Medicine Certified Personal Trainer test, he did just that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have been a trainer for the past decade and it has been one of the most fulfilling and humbling experiences," wrote Wai. "To be a point of inspiration, a support system, receiving praise on how I was changing their life for the better left me humbled and in awe."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-became-interested-in-physical-fitness-at-age-13></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He became interested in physical fitness at age 13</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wai's interest in fitness didn't start in college. He's had an interest in "physical health and conditioning" ever since he was 13 years old. "As a typical teenager I was insecure with my size and strength and decided to incorporate exercise and physical fitness into my life and it has been a large part of my life ever since," he wrote on his website.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-will-likely-appear-on-season-11-of-vanderpump-rules></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He will likely appear on season 11 of Vanderpump Rules</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Daniel Wai/instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2023, Wai joined Madix and her Vanderpump Rules costars on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cast trip to San Francisco</a>.
