The Duchess of Cambridge shares <b>Prince George</b>, 3, and <b>Princess Charlotte</b>, 23 months, with her husband, <b><a href=#>Prince William</a></b>.</p><p>“It is lonely at times,” she told a room full of attendees at the opening of the new Global Academy. “You do feel quite isolated … But actually, so many other mothers are going through exactly what you’re going through. But it’s being brave enough, like you obviously were, to reach out.”</p><p>Middleton, 35, was speaking to <b>Katie Massie-Taylor</b> and <b>Sarah Hesz</b>, the cofounders of Mush, an app that connects new mothers with one another to create a virtual support system.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>At the event, Middleton <a href=#>also chatted with 16-year-old</a> <b>Oliver Monger</b> about not being afraid to speak out. “I’ve not really had a problem I’ve needed to talk to someone about, but meeting you is a new thing,” he told the Duchess. “I don’t really know how to speak to someone so high. I’m quite shy.”</p><p>Middleton reassured him, “I’m shy as well, so don’t worry.” Her admission comes in the same week that her brother-in-law, <b><a href=#>Prince Harry</a></b>, <a href=#>revealed he sought therapy following his mother’s tragic 1997 death</a>.</p><p>“[I was] sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?” Harry, 32, told <i>The Telegraph</i> for its <i>Mad World</i> podcast. “It’s only going to make you sad, it’s not going to bring her back. So from an emotional side, I was like, ‘Right, don’t ever let your emotions be part of anything.’”</p><p>The British royal added that he got very close to a “complete breakdown” in the years following <b>Princess Diana</b>’s death due to “all sorts of grief and sort of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the Global Academy event Thursday, Harry’s older brother William, 34, told students, “The strongest guys are the ones who can talk about it.“</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSaeq61w52jnqyfo3quu9OhnKugn6Sxbq%2FAp2SmmZuaerq71Gadnp2cYrmwusSlsGaZnpl6qr%2FOpZitnZRixHWDl2locmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
