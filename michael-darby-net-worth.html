Throughout RHOP's six seasons, Michael was accused of cheating on Ashley or flirting with other men on the show. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine, he was accused in 2018 of sexual assault when a cameraman alleged that Michael grabbed and groped his posterior during filming. As a result, Michael was suspended from filming.</p><p>However, two months later, the charges against Michael were dropped due to insufficient evidence and he resumed filming. Ashley later said on RHOP, "When I got the news, I just froze. It was not real that something like this was happening to my husband and I. My heart was racing, I was getting light-headed. Like, this just can’t be my reality."</p><p>Ashley has also battled previous rumors of Michael flirting with the other Househusbands.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Michael Darby</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Real Estate Agent</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $20 million</p><p>Real estate mogul Michael Darby met Ashley Darby when she was bartending at a bar he co-owned.

We have decided to separate."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She added, "People will be quick to assume that the causes were too much intrusion by reality TV into the most personal parts of our lives, age gap issues, cultural problems, or child-rearing differences." Ashley admitted that “pieces of all these may have affected our pure love for each other, but no one reason is the root cause of our mutual decision to go our separate ways."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2ackaevunnNnqtmr5%2Bnwak%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
