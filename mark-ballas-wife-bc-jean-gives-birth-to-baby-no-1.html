Coming soon.”</p><p>The baby announcement came three months after Ballas officially <a href=#>confirmed his retirement</a> from DWTS. He previously departed after season 25 but <a href=#>returned for season 31</a> in 2022, winning the mirrorball trophy along with partner <a href=#><strong>Charli D’Amelio</strong></a>.</p><p>“I’ve done 20 seasons now. I started this journey when I was 21, 22 and honestly being able to dance and perform for you fans — you guys are the best fans,” the Emmy nominee said during the last Dancing With the Stars tour stop in Las Vegas in March.</p><p>While making the announcement, Ballas gave several of his loved ones a shout-out, including his wife.</p><p>“My mom is here tonight, my dad is here tonight, my wife is here tonight, my wife’s mom and dad are here tonight,” he said at the time. “I just want to finish this by saying that this will be the last time you see me dance in this capacity. I’m coming to a close tonight. This is going to be my last dance.”</p><p>Although the choreographer is leaving his DWTS days behind him, several of his colleagues from the reality competition show have been an integral part of his and Jean’s love story. <a href=#><strong>Derek Hough</strong></a> even served as Ballas’ best man at <a href=#>their 2016 nuptials</a>.</p><p>“Witnessing their love be sealed under a beautiful Oak tree in front of family friends was such a special moment,” Hough wrote via Instagram at the time.</p><p>Ballas and Jean, for their part — who met at a singer-songwriter night hosted by a mutual friend in 2012 — have continued to gush about each other since tying the knot.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I still can’t put into words how you make me feel, life with you is always an adventure & you have completely taken over my heart,” the three-time <a href=# rel=noopener>Mirrorball champion</a> wrote via Instagram in 2019. “I’ve never laughed as hard as I have with you, I’ve never appreciated the world, time, nature & life as much as I have with you. … Saying I love you just isn’t enough. I promise to show every day for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Jean, meanwhile, shared a sweet birthday tribute to her husband via Instagram in May. “Happy Birthday to my favorite human who I’m lucky enough to call my husband. Hendrix & I love you more than anything in this entire universe. HBD handsome 🎈🎂🫶🏼✨,” she captioned the post, referring to their dog.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammaKgeqOty6WYrGWnnrOmecGcZKOdkaN6qLXVnqpmmpmnwal506hkm5mSrnqvu4xqZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
